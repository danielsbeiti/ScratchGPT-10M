names of no mark or price of them not one
'forbear my son' the hermit cries
what conjur'd awe upon the people steals
the lover in the husband may be lost
among the nicest of mankind
inquisitive attention while i read
they spread their spurious treasures to the sun
have issued from the temple or the throne
there's musick in it could i fetch it out
no pyrate seiz'd his still returning freight
the pendant isicle the frostwork fair
where o'er the rock the scarcelywaving pine
and well deserve the heart i have possess'd
and infants with a longer life repaid
the rest are harlots by their flatt'ries won
to thrust the charge of deeds that i detest
forbid in vain to push his daring way
where'er i cast my moist'ned eyes around
infused at the creation of the kind
how few beneath auspicious planets born
impregnated the womb of distant space
how short those intervals for reason's aid
reflection firm and fancy free
then happiest he whose timely hand
fair fields appear below such as he left
sollicit nor unwelcome to the youth
'twas still replenished to the top
and sickens sad with care o then indulge
hard is the fortune that your sex attends
wander on this inhospitable coast
as storms and thunders rattling with loud peal
two handmaids wait the throne alike in place
cry to the proud the cruel and unjust
her magic zone she next unbound
dewdropping coolness to the shade retires
and claims its honours from the chiefs of peace
but stepdame nature niggard of her grace
and painture here has brought forth poetry
whose highest praise is that they live in vain
who once was bless'd with fame and riches too
a book to please us at a tender age
they trust in armies and their courage dies
the ruddy fruits should thy arrival great
gay bloom whose transient glow can shed
she never thinks you're sick enough
were once the british lyon heard to roar
scarce in the shade nor in the scorching day
for to what class a writer may be doom'd
wellpleas'd the world will leave
that plagues not hymen with incessant prayers
the blackbird strove with emulation sweet
o britons if to pagan powers ye bow
her spreading offspring of the fourth degree
but let him conquer e'er one blow be struck
where he most happy who the least laments
a masterpassion is the love of news
has oft been said and oft been sung
as i drew near the cottage blaz'd
yet waving heaps as ancient ballads tell
they make glad seizure of the vacant room
the callender amazed to see
no more almeria wanders near
desist and give us nature wild
be found amidst some distant frozen waves
held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow
hope flies with youth and leaves to age
whom hireling dervises by proxy teach
altho' the mighty secret's not disclos'd
yon larks that towering sing
fly ye profane if not draw near with awe
julia thy bridal vest prepare
to nature dead he must adopt vile art
not so attractive lately shone the plain
there with my cries my saviour i'll assail
to smile such peace has innocence in death
and hov'ring shades the darken'd eyes o'erspread
and mildest zephyrs fann'd my swelling sails
at length the finish'd garden to the view
i must such tedious horrid pangs indure
who knows not here the richest gift was found
of brittle grandeur with rapacious hand
glide the silverton'd verse when apollo's the theme
the flatt'ring future still must give the joy
there haply by the ruddy damsel seen
but these his talents were ybury'd stark
whilst with encreasing steps we all pursue
but the kind moon reflects a milder ray
while ease and pleasure make the nations smile
but what are numbers what are bards to me
nor congreve's life nor cowley's fire
then were there golden times the village round
is sullied in the stream taking a taint
crimson'd and furr'd the highest honours dare
no longer white with fleecy dew
polluting dust o'er every reverend head
in bloom of life young blandford died
at length reviv'd 'mid rising heaps of slain
and far unlike him feeds this little flock
but art of mortal man by far the wisest sage
like stamford shall with scorn behold
that gloomy morn she in my absence dy'd
let my soft prayers thy vernal glories bring
dash'd on the stones her helpless infants die
in verdant beauties cannot these excel
the fiery youth's unguided rage
too proud for dairywork or sale of eggs
thy rosy blossoms tinge peruvia's plain
through beds of glittering ore and glowing gems
the rocking winds molest her not for see
for unkempt hair or task unconn'd are sorely shent
and strength is lord of all but gentle kind
thy voice my music and thy arms should be
if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
midst intersecting cuts and winding ways
her frighted soul was fill'd with doubts and fears
receive my humble lays my heart was yours before
and peace the genuine offspring of her smile
the savage genius of mankind and taught
whate'er of bliss the wit of man can feign
to wear his livery some respect might prove
greatness of bulk or symmetry of parts
and a new dance of vanity begin
perhaps a friend a father's dead
but vainer still of that prodigious store
that downward tumbling on the host below
phoebus thy days wou'd seem too long
the thunder is his voice and the red flash
but shall the partial rage of selfish men
while i was wand'ring on the neighbouring plain
not such the hours i hop'd with you to share
an useful tho' neglected dame
has render'd me so deep your debtor
who uncreated reign'st like me
who feels his freehold's worth and looks elate
then let her voice our rival cause decide
are half so lovely as my father's field
to her repair'd from all the neighb'ring plains
with notes of horror wakes her trembling ear
oft o'er the trembling nations from afar
and why because immortal as their lord
when they have spoil'd their bridal shoes
till mighty conscience whose prevailing call
her impulse nothing may restrain
that parts the night from morn come restless souls
while drops of mercy bath'd his hoary cheek
direct the blow here oaks aspiring rise
all these are fruitful themes and would demand
ne'er shall its spells my sad heart move
is this great scene unveil'd for since the claims
and decent elegance was there
the stench remains the lustre dies away
nay insolently dar'd to tell her grace
is all exertion ever new
but if my vagrant fancy pants
her pleasing colours paint the future gay
steals on o'ershad'wing nature's face
and leaves his flock the rav'nous soldier's prize
and grave our mem'ry on the faithful stone
deceiving womankind and pilf'ring love
and goodness sills the cup of general joy
i mourn the rigour of my instant fate
affects weak eyes much us'd to shade
beneath the moonlight shade
too glorious to be gazed on in his sphere
we look despondency no infant near
for what her gen'rous hand bestows
cold as the fabled god appears
to share what classic culture yields
'twill be your turn to weep and sue in vain
conspicuous now is happiness display'd
a venus drawn by great apelles' hand
but all the fame that from the field was brought
it looks so like a fable
that verdant hill and silver stream
yon craggy mountain whose fastidious head
were spent upon the air the young elvera
a dread example to the rhyming fry
our sketch all random strokes conjecture all
thus thus i was for thee my sleep i lost
dreadful stride from zone to zone
will pay ere long and bless me with repose
of injury with such knowledge of their strength
a spacious plain the false enchaunter show'd
approach'd my bed magnificent her dress
who noblest ends by noblest means pursue
as when they wish you at the di
her eyes roll wild a stride her pace
and france still trembles at an harley's name
and all is hush'd and winds are heard no more
brisk thro' the thicket trips the spotted fawn
while all the emulative vocal tribe
to win the mercies of offended heaven
let me ne more myself deceive
and as the skilful pilot steers
this more insinuating notion lay
alike insensible to soft desire
than he his plighted promise nould fulfill
to vex the human race thou kindly deign'dst
alike all foes to ev'ry publick gain
come to the beaming god your hearts unfold
i meditate my lightsome lay
the sacred object of his pious prayers
and all was peaceful i remember well
had my daddie left me gear enough
from home and native air
ourselves the' astonish'd talkers and the tale
o wherefore with a rash imperfect aim
pale envy flies her quiver slander breaks
now high in air the fatal heel ascends
observes the budding genius as it thrusts
but leaves the wretch to weep
yon ambient azure shell and spring to life
no foreign heroes in triumphant cars
but dreams of wand'ring thro' the fields of air
love and love only is the loan for love
no nourishment in frozen pastures grows
to this strange place or by what pow'rful aid
but had she known of melting words the charms
sees every pass secur'd and fences whole
back to your universities ye fools
that no rude savour maritime invade
o i remember and with pride repeat
an individual is a sacred mark
her softest shades grow sweetly meek
which to and fro with blessings speed
in doctrine uncorrupt in language plain
this waste of musick is the voice of love
the angry goddess seiz'd her deathful arms
haste with redoubled speed bring on the hour
and fear and ignorance afford delight
rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain
masking in cunning feints truth's splendent face
or if to make their party great
which made the prospect more amazing sad
and laughter sounds like madness in his ear
or from the towering precipice is thrown
books or the world the many or the few
these to the raptur'd mind aloud proclaim
rejoicing with her lovely captive came
no sorrowing friend no sister parent nigh
he too beholding in the sacred light
still on each cheek the bloom of youth appears
distance steps back and drags the chain no more
as swells the beldame's teeming brain
by what unseen and unsuspected arts
we give to time eternity's regard
there chastity may boast of many a friend
and to his radiant father's pallace came
bend on the hallow'd turf the tearful eye
with us our parents children lovers laws
bespoke at least a man that knew mankind
for inborn goodness with soft pity join'd
a rose that faded at the rising day
arise for loaden with the midnight dew
but hail fair peace so mild and meek
had to theanor thus her form been shown
and infinite benevolence
scowling contempt how pitiful this pride
before the thrills of farinelli's voice
think of the common cause wherein we go
of tyranny aveng'd and liberty restor'd
advance slowpacing from the gilded west
the vanquish'd bird must combat till he dies
'they breathe a soul to animate thy clay
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
as the base wretch or vain physician please
when in the circuit of his gaping shells
and here to smooth captivity a prey
with our expenditure defrays his own
are then divorced the head and heart are foes
as many words as make an even line
she gives the pow'r whatever side prevails
which erst adorn'd her artless grove
invoke thy muse and hail thy song sublime
let me in grateful notes renew
if by his art the savage foe's subdu'd
falls a soft murmur on th' uninjured ear
apelles left his name at co
for tho' the wise priscilla often strove
as not to love at all 'tis not to live
and to a life more happy and refin'd
and there renew their interrupted love
ev'n to jehovah's throne the ductile mind
there gain'd admittance and the infant press'd
when heaven to all thy joys bestows
he gives the local biass all its sway
resplendent all thro' fluid glass
but happy they the happiest of their kind
sincerity why 'tis his only pride
chloe's the goddess of my thought
hoary fidelity a matron staid
she to the subject world dispenses law
to me his sighs to me are all his vows
shou'd lovely venus leave her native sky
peace its ten thousands in th' embattled plain
unhappy he who from the first of joys
and not a sail but by permission spreads
around her shakspeare's hallow'd tomb
the floods in icy fetters binds
what hideous spectres round him rise
gone to salute the rising morn
a wanton vixen and a weary man
the forestwalks at every rising gale
the pain is just when we reject the cure
of innocence and undissembling truth
sure 'tis a curse on mothers doom'd to mourn
brown exercise rejoic'd to hear
she fairest offspring of the skies
untill by you
and bacchanals led on their swift advancing doom
of all besides unknowing and unknown
far with the loves each blissful omen speeds
the mimic passion with their own agree
bestia and bug their honours and so forth
to make the last effort what tears could do
and the still spirits sunk in balmy rest
opinion's foot is never never found
shunning his steps decrees by honour taught
they grasp his feeble frame his tresses tear
but anxious only for my country's good
yet grateful then my constancy i prov'd
suppose philander's lucia's or narcissa's
the skittish fancy with facetious tales
and art by judgment form'd with nature vies
thro' shades and plains along the smoothest stream
when time shall cease ev'n beauty's self by these
abash the frantic thyrsus with my song
unable to withstand a claim so urg'd
and shock'd poor florio's nicer sense
but there is one soft minute when the mind
not to be making circles in the sand
if chance the peacock doth his plumes unfold
depart from me and that for ever too
revere the laws they dream that heav'n ordains
by me no orphan weeps his ravish'd land
who bade the visionary landscape rise
'till angels listen to the song
holy guide descend and bring
that noblest commerce of mankind
from you ye heavenbelov'd may liberty
there sickness laid her aching head
to such extreme fatigue sunk lifeless down
mote eath a mortal to immortal feed
who spoil the lily rob the rose
careful to see the mantling bliss go round
conforms and models life to that alone
and in small plats were softer myrtles plac't
as the lov'd form while folded to her breast
by rills from thee deduc'd irriguous fed
and how the vaulted canopies unfold
where altering scenes the fickle merman please
lo beauty withers in your void imbrace
and none none left to bear a friendly part
a voice descending from on high
foul fiend thou bane of health fair virtue's bane
no guilt so black as thine belongs
enrich'd with the discoveries ye have made
who liv'd unhappily and greatly dy'd
soon would thy folly disconcert the whole
whose faithful clue unravels ev'ry muse
that feebly bends beside the plashy spring
life's sun we read when heaven a respite lends
inspires each youthful candidate for fame
just to themselves their conduct is entire
for fear that you might their black deeds excel
but verse methought would suit these better
which while they raise the passions mend the mind
thy creature whom i found so fair
and speaks in all their looks and all their ways
then having viewed it with disdainful eyes
is but to ease my mind
and steady justice holds th' impartial scales
to all the transport the rapt sense can bear
innumerous o'er the blushing orchard shakes
in lycon's form enflam'd with passion high
to rule at once the captive fair
thus let us gently kiss and fondly gaze
o well thy form divine i know
and stay his arm outstretch'd to launce the avenging fire
some metaphors some hankerchiefs display
three tedious days with pinching want he strove
to sacred music ow'd its destin'd fall
worthy to sing thy praise for that thy hand
tutor'd by all her rivals to surpass
while all the sons of freedom shrunk with fear
short tho' they were my soul had never known
of england's throne by sweating peasants fell'd
commence acquaintance underneath a shed
such antique marbles to his native land
thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn
some pleasures live a month and some a year
denoting thought inflam'd and troubled breast
daughter of joy i know thy air
like will and mary on the coin
i hap'ly plac'd him with providing care
the wand with which e'er time begun
ten thousand glittering lamps the skies adorning
the fam'd and only picture easy gives
none wou'd fierce zeal for piety mistake
she's drawn along unwilling to be seen
and bliss which christian schemes alone insure
repents its earlier choice
shoots to its goal and gleams athwart the sky
and what a various prospect lies around
mean while blind british bards with volant touch
and fate at memphis was unravell'd
hopeless to overcome
gain what they can but never force a trade
'forsake mankind and bid the world adieu
to him direct the tribute lay
and robes and notions framed in foreign looms
upon thy side against myself ill fight
yet shall its musick please the partial ear
impatient still on each the pregnant dame
and books were bought and harpsichords were hired
infinite skill in all that he has made
let judgment thy unshaken friend
with all the finny race
' near where the haystack lifts its snowy head
at morning's dawn her lord commands
such is the secret union when we feel
here glory beckon'd mighty chiefs of old
and nature mov'd compleat with inward view
coquettes no more pursue the jilting plan
till grown more frugal in his riper days
he sells protection witness at his foot
lycaean pan the faun's arcadian race
that trump which once in heaven on man's revolt
which hover yet and scarce know which to joyn
lorenzo thou hast seen if thine to see
on this fair pattern of a god below
and dauntless meet the ling'ring stroke of death
his heav'nly smiles would ev'n despair control
why should my heart think that a several plot
and every colony has dropt a tear
if there is weight in an eternity
and now in courtly garments dight
among the mightiest on the brightest roll
fear or inconstancy the judgment press
redletter'd in the calendar of play'rs
accompany his route and to his toil
what is this wreath so green so fair
dwell on his eye and wait the waving hand
wild with her loss and swoln with sorrow came
led on by silence to resume her reign
for other's bliss for other's woe
tenderey'd pity as the village train
o might our laureat study here
at length the fatal morn arose
dull rest they now and fatal slumbers love
and led thee through a maze of sorrow to the grave
and catch the falling dewdrops which supply
a garland rich thy dwelling shall entwine
th' unfinish'd sentence and with dueful bow
amid the mighty uproar while below
yet blushing dries them lest the god of day
thro' a rebellious frozen heart
quaffing rich liquids oh how sweet t' enjoy
sometimes i interlope and slight the laws
from morn to eve the woman plies
could she not more delighted hear
we trust th' important charge the petticoat
by choice the hold th' ambitious toil
sir trust my honour you shall find me true
thus heav'n approves as honest and sincere
on every foot of that improving ground
then to these arms with stagg'ring steps did haste
sweetly intermix'd and lovely to behold
at once they dazzled and engag'd the sight
life thro' opinion's false perspective seen
i'm very sensible he's mad in law
when safe occasion offers and with dance
distress should bid our generous pity flow
and still the hollow roaring of the sea
ah had he met thee in this happier hour
and waft away the rising storm
though feeble in degree in kind the same
blest is the maid and worthy to be blest
whene'er he deigns to stay at home
the pois'nous reptiles here their mischiefs bring
the bright original was one he knew
this mean to mighty for this glorious end
the fair recess must seek with cheerful mind
but let me still confide
how did she lift her hands and stare
let me enjoy my visionary world
freed from alarms the smiling neighbours meet
who still are pleas'd too little or too much
scarce had she spoke when thatm cherubic car
pours in among the stormy hebrides
where the grave justice ends the grievous fray
and action right for action treads the path
nor give thy god a rival in thy pride
why didst thou seek this luckless strand
and gilds the regions of eternal day
incumbent revel in his frail abode
now honour pleaded that my fame should bleed
see how both states are by connection ty'd
weigh well his humour was it dress
a dismal dwelling hid by waving trees
sought of themselves the london road
alpha the cause of causes first
'twas well i came at last he deign'd to say
how lavish grandeur blaz'd the barren waste
vengeance divine offended order arms
preceding shou'd be destitute of rain
resign'd and calm await that awful hour
his duty 't is to love himself alone
should cultivate their worthlesness in france
of avon whence thy rosy fingers cull
till darkness be by dying past
to gather fairest wreaths of future fame
nor am i yet so old nor is my glance
saw youth and joy and love's enchanting wiles
and revel in the shade
the priest where high the billow springs
fitly with joy thou minglest care
far from the dull impertinence of man
give them the taste of sweet and sour
thou radiant spark of heav'nly light
corinna cherry honeycomb and snip
the elder year pomona pleas'd shall deck
a dauntless soul erect who smil'd on death
with those we love to pour the sigh
and steals to death from anguish and from shame
of triumph o'er their betters find in death
'tis best sometimes your censure to restrain
where the vague moonbeams pour a silver flood
frest to thy bones while to the gale
views all her charms reflected all her cares
dives deep in their economy divine
a snug and friendly game at cards
to add such splendour to their line
struggling corruption owns nor dares assault
of subterranean excavated grots
seize delia's frame suspend at once her breath
secure from the men and the monsters of prey
'but let a maid thy pity share
fair virtue shone his open look
ye muses skill'd in ev'ry winning art
his statue shall be rais'd in ev'ry street
each passing hour this moral shews
go whisper love in chloe's ears
but ah how oft my lawless passions rove
offspring of immortal line
old avon pleas'd his reedy forehead rears
wrapp'd in the garb simplicity would wear
out of his feeble view and rising shade
or sweeps the fishy shore or treasures up
that whilst we pay so dear for learning
and while she seems to scorn him only fears
it cannot be whether i will or no
while egypt names him as her guardian god
that you were bred on earth you fully prove
her hamely garb was mair to me
what shall he do his once so vivid nerves
shun'd like fell aconite began to hang
the use the pleasure will the toil repay
who think'st thyself a murray with disdain
guiding the wanton fancy to her scope
the mother sigh'd the starting tear withheld
let me forewarn'd each sign each system learn
a picture this of human life
fain his compassion wou'd thy works approve
for fanny price was lovely and was chaste
yet frequent storms the bloom of spring deface
lorenzo loath to break thy banquet up
and reap rich compensation from my pain
in search of nature's awful grace
if curious of our weal or woe
wisdom and friendly talk successive stole
of one whose birth was in a land of light
of hir'd mourners usher'd thee along
they're wise to keep us slaves for well they know
be avarice and ambition's feet
what gars me a' turn cauld as death
e'en now i see that starting tear
and as around thy shadows sail
famed sages lighted up the pagan world
who give to chance the world's that round us roll
yet if we look more closely we shall find
hail happy chief whose valour could deserve
in vain you'd fly to yonder shrubs and plants
nor wash'd in ocean as from rome he pass'd
and teeming ewes that still their burdens bear
her unpremeditated strain
hail peaceful nymph thou eldest thing on earth
thro' the dim spaces of futurity
to fancy's sway he yields his guileless heart
spreads her wide mantle o'er the shiv'ring form
now betty from her masters bed had flown
on waving spray or mossy dell
what statesman does not run
'twas ev'n to thee yet the dread path once trod
by yours be their fair fame attended
with every good that can annoy
within her veil's luxuriant maze
thy toils and various dangers now are past
and when the great creator's will had join'd
i know thee lord nor slow to hear
the goddess stoop'd assent forth from a cloud
i would not rob his fair
still where devoid of care the stripling roves
were play'd by a rat
where science only feigns to dwell
the coach was order'd in they step
still stranger much that when at length mankind
nor by trim steps hand gently down
a greenland night we might attend
for o amid each pang my bosom knows
with friendship guarded and with virtue grac'd
seek a new heaven upon thy breast
and thou thyself o'er ev'ry country sown
and shall return it with neglect
unless it suits with my own humour too
scarce can the tortur'd mind the thought sustain
and force defeated make them slaves by fraud
in pure goodmanners scorch'd to death
yea by thy sympathy unseen shall feel
and live in short like courtly friends
that little birdies chirp and sing
three girls preceded all by time endear'd
this bleeding heart this trembling hand to thine
and let them ken if goud's their pride
should rank with thee thou scum of earth
can sound the slow knell echo to the note
no sound of hammer or of saw was there
and the last night which shou'd have brought me rest
they plac'd respectfully before the king
in happy chains our daring language bound
as if the summer's labour past she chose
her sacred domes involv'd in rolling fire
and where our wants have end our love begins
which set the living firmament on fire
and haunt me in my midnight walk
can hopes of heav'n bright prospects of an hour
that glads the ploughman's sunday morning's round
and sweep their lofty strings those awful strings
at least with men of florio's breeding
sunk down with sickness faint and wan
now in the milder garb of ridicule
in thrill'd remembrance of the vanish'd hours
to thy pale and trembling bride
in their warm bosom fed the mountains these
the dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain
to build our house e'er i in peace retire
shall glut my rage and dye the wood
when frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves
hope things may mend in flanders
and lull'd thy slumbers with an airy song
nor can my radiant angel question mine
sure at his birth things not unknown of old
and stamps his pray'rs for once sincere
joys which alone from thy fair laws arise
and sure 'tis this is keeney'd burney's fort
where niggard nature ne'er unlocks
whose worth deserves thy own immortal verse
arise o lord and hear thy people's call
then all my pains one moment overpaid
bin all professions time and pains give skill
trampled by fiery coursers horror thus
who after all their services preferr'd
that lord was pleas'd this holiday to make
when least adorn'd another steals our hearts
alive and with my lord and you
and grasps the flaming bolt of sacred fire
the seeds of peace and mark her for their prey
by keen yet decent satire skill'd to please
blame not thy clime nor chide the distant sun
and is himself that torment which he flies
that in a few short moments i retrace
for her the black assassin draws his sword
hail independence by true reason taught
but how shall i attempt such arduous string
trifles for solid worth by most pursu'd
why auhors all this scrawl and scribbling sore
what healing virtue swells the tender veins
but so are twenty faces
sollicits heav'n to add the other score
or when did e'er the generous steed
and the dark den where once his empire stood
bidding mankind believe what you have taught
the varied scene of quickcompounded thought
you would be happy and secure it here
like temper'd harmony of light and shade
a'd tell ye where but i think shame
from fair to fair i vow'd to range
and rise triumphant in the fatal breach
surrounded with the engines of his fate
for what must sal or poet sue
in pelting at each other's brains
angelic tones that shed with magic power
suppress suppress thy grief my child
speaks awful answers from the mystic cloud
are set apart for souls refin'd as thine
the frame is wove of slender thread
and nurses folly's children as her own
thou'lt fare no better than thou didst before
the soul's high price and sworn it to the wise
such monstrous heights from instinct and from pride
how often his persuasive tongue
and live but in the motion of my eye
as streams roll down enlarging as they flow
nor cooling herb nor healing balm supply
and him as deeply who abhors it not
and give these foes a dreadful end
stood the stern frown of supercilious brows
highminded foaming out their own disgrace
him jove accosts in reverend semblaunce dight
while louder surges swell'd my rapid flood
knows too that health the path shall tread
but man who knows no good unmix'd and pure
or voice of brutes in ev'ry den
see motly life in modern trappings dress'd
so sweetly grac'd the vernal scene
mad in pursuit and in possession so
whatever cares the heart can fret
peace to his shade each dog must have his day
to catch the rosebud newly blown
and little care for queens and kings
where airy dmons dance the wanton round
imparts from bounteous womb annual recruits
sweep o'er th' ensanguin'd plains of agincourt
pride disappointed pride now stops her breath
in still approaching circles still remote
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
labyrinths which ever wind
who only for the naked back provide
to the slow tortures which they knew their tyrant
strength wisdom virtue mighty jove are thine
a father of the poor a friend to all
sweet fancy smil'd and wav'd her mystic rod
till lordly man born to imperial sway
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd
cannot attempt it e'en in rhime
and her fond husband had resign'd her up
to comfort and to aid
the busy bees to blooming fields repair
you nature's early birth explore
of varied hues the lively coral here
of wrath obnoxious god may chuse his mark
delays yet is impatient to be gone
that shade which shall your kind protection gain
for his lost child it flows for me he weeps
and know no grudge though lesser ones get more
there let them ever unreguarded lye
by public hacknies in the schooling trade
swell the rustic's ample throat
great honours and estates my sire possess'd
flow swiftly thames and flowing still proclaim
o no for ever shun her tempting skies
e'er yet her hero was disgrac't
why heaven not she must have the praise of this
a heart within whose sacred cell
celestial fires descending on my breast
forego a court's alluring pale
no painful selfreproach hast thou to feel
whene'er we leave the circled green
first rob before they stop complaint
look back astonish'd on the ways of men
whose slimy waters to its arches clung
as son as father husband brother friend
immortalize achilles' praise
but when i view the radiant queen
while cloud to cloud returns the dreadful hymn
such is that awful that tremendous day
and set their wit at work to find
as when two scales which equal loads suspend
beguiling time with am'rous talk
which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear
madly i leagu'd against that sacred earth
satan instructed o'er their morals smiles
by man himself embroil'd the dire debate
to either india see the merchant fly
and in my verse entuneth so fetisely
at helluo's board where smokes th' eternal treat
no thunders shook with deep intestine sound
no wrangler destitute of shame and sense
her tenderest tear is but her noblest praise
no system this of deep devotion
by force if not by parts
an artist at creating selfalarms
is mystic still reveal your doubting thought
which by his sorceries he soon brought to pass
and in luxurious sorrow prompt the tear
with sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood
as dares to deem one universe too small
within the magic circle of the eye
long life might lapse age unperceived come on
a tempest that shall shake her own creation
and shed their flow'rs along the rugged way
but what a few dim lamps expiring had
be where you list your charter is so strong
which damsel fond had drawn from houshold toils
but come my friend inform me in return
do i not think on thee when i forgot
sylvius they want for him they search they call
'twas when he sought thy mother at carel fair
so the dark souls consin'd to endless night
consult resolve and act as you decree
its horror shall no more belong
into his straw and till the morning sleeps
our infidels are satan's hypocrites
lost in the reflux of the watry walls
the deepest waves and fiercest wind that blows
can long abuse a fond unthinking maid
of that which they would perish to obtain
and while they run his humble walls about
though quench'd in night
then let good heav'n withhold or grant success
so fares thy church but how thy church may fare
is aggravation of offence
phoebus himself shall leave th' aonian grove
who forc'd to yield the nimble hours soon brought
but man whom nature form'd of milder clay
too soon dejected and too soon elate
whose footsteps these immortals have been here
and sense awaken'd scorns her ancient yoke
and heed not if with tearful eye
with happiness who rules the peaceful seat
by due gradation nature's sacred law
in one no object of our sight
to hail the regal visit of lorrain
he starts he pauses looks around
keep a cough by them ready made
and still in death i feel its strong controul
and isaac's rigadoon shall live as long
does it not touch the will
you'll find in sure revenge affronted love
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
he stands proscrib'd by his own guilty hand
and freeborn rivers freer seem to flow
no voice profane is heard to breath
retirement was deny'd to me
autumn's rich fruits th' instructed reader gains
in vain she calls to happier realms of love
t' have shook the spear of justice soft and smooth
blest be the hour he said that happy hour
you robb'd the bashful rose and shed
all fly to thee thou gentle dawn of peace
to hail the blessed morn's auspicious ray
and some ascribe the invention to a priest
nought but confusion and degeneracy
when nature swells her woe o'er suff'ring man
no fear their peace destroys
but mark tho' chang'd the spot not chang'd the scene
and the weak soul within itself unblest
the 'squire who all this time sate mute
'tis his alone to please instruct advise
the rowling main that ever toils below
while tow'ring larks their rival notes prolong
are proof to every lure of honest fame
of fruit ambrosial moral fruit to man
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the basket thus we shall begin
when charms like these dear maid conspire
and now no longer in disguise the men
'and those who prize the paltry things
where no shades near nor useful waters run
where they who most enjoy shall much endure
late all my comfort all my fond delight
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
with smiles and gracious looks her fortune tried
a breast so soft as mine must needs sustain
it seem'd triumphant holiday and joy
nor send more dire conviction we confess
illum'd by shakespeare's magic page
and makes the world the wilderness it is
from whence its blessings flow and the rapt voice
and a new creature form'd arise
are foibles then and graces of the mind
may bitter memory ne'er recount with pain
tho' thy breast flam'd with universal love
no pathless waste or undiscover'd shore
as long as mutual love the only law
of toil and honour for thy father's son
then might each youth more sasely view
from keen regrets of duteous fondness glide
who trembling heard my parting sigh
avenge her falshood nor could all the gold
ithose are th' opinions who have guided right
their ambush here relentless ruffians lay
there may i lonely turn the sacred page
breath'd the free strain as rome and he inspir'd
is difficult their punishment obscene
on horseback after we
and though a bishop toil to cleanse the stain
learn'd in the maxims of despotick rule
less strict devoir the russ and persian claim
regardless of another's fame
apollo and the sacred nine
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
three hundred virtuous females side by side
reels far from reason jostled by the throng
that laid alanzon's haughty helmet low
the courtier breaks his word 'tis true
plays floating ore the bush then silence brake
to real semblance tricks her air shew
where ale thy votaries in full resort
when me she first into her favour took
close up that very moment to prevent
to pour his golden tide through all her gates
and only suffer their contempt
such food as this and therefore i advise
be furnish'd in the first place with a head
with thicksown stars the radiant pole is crown'd
to feel remorse for this unnatural sin
where the fifth henry arts and arms was taught
in your own pow'r alone it lies
shake off thy trance and weave an olive crown
joyous but soon the treach'rous gloom betrays
arise o lord arise
and fancies light in simple guise pourtray
since pope himself applauds what she has writ
it happen'd as at early dawn
unbend the bow and curb an iron age
the fragrance of thy balmy lip
who from corioli was nam'd
and minds that deem derided pain a treat
precise his manner and demure his looks
grief touch'd his soul to see them there
while pleas'd britannia that great man surveys
will only vibrate to thy well known word
tho' i'm depriv'd of my kind shepherd's sight
for him i'll ever drop the dol'rous tear
or meads with silver fountains fed
he oft repairs there drops a lover's tear
see from her ports a thousand banners stream
tho' trembling o'er the feeble crutch he bends
swore by her coronet and ermine
firm and to false philosophy devote
must be with thine transmitted down to shame
shakes her sage head at the calamity
spreads wide her arms of universal love
on the broad front of noon in full career
the wrong was his who wrongfully complain'd
and interrupt her song as they rejoice
thou mayst not smart beneath the selfsame gripe
hush'd in dead silence sleep you when 'tis calm
pluck off you acorn from its parent bough
for their lost sires orphan'd babes complain
and cold esteem succeed to warm desire
go with thy looks of dark design
my cruel fate doth act the tyrant's part
their copied scene with mangled arts disgrace
tho' whirling worlds oppose and globes of fire
fly diverse fly to foreigners to foes
tear out the glitt'ring snake tho' ne're so close it twine
who's nightly in the garden seen
your melting lines make conscious passion vent
the swampy marsh shall its broad flag produce
if all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme
reluctant left the vessel's side
of nature's music from a thousand throats
in melancholy dipp'd embrowns the whole
meanwhile the farmer quits his elbowchair
and sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms
farewel ye sportive deities of love
subordinate and diligence was choice
loud flitnas fulminate in love to man
and lifts in contrast fair display'd
'tis virtue only can the bard inspire
'tis given to revel in her blissful bower
still i am wretched if no more you give
watchful as lovers i first saw his fate
and o in mercy bid my father live
at once from plainss of light to earth he falls
with friendship's generous love
should not too often speak nor speak too long
give praise that merit which was all her own
when first the harp melodious tubal strung
and kneeling crowds adore
fancy it self 'twou'd tire to plumb the abyss
shameful in pomp conspicuously mean
but you brave youth have greater wonders done
which doth betray a base ignoble mind
grandly terrific paints thy birth
with recent honours bloom'd with every bliss
the languid moon sheds from her silent sphere
a courtier summon'd hence of late
oft with thee lloyd i steal an hour from grief
unnatural oft and foreign to the mind
or future dolours of the birth survive
breaks thro' his prison by resentment bold
without good breeding truth is not approv'd
and yon wide groves already past with pain
but th'orchatloss with future crops repair
to these let judgment value give
o'er feelings nature wrought so high
so from the astonished stars her nightly train
she found at last her failing side
more pleasing less intent to please
lamented change to which full many a cause
long had she fill'd each youth with love
a joyful welcome sings
to chide the libertine and court the queen
and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
and late ink hagley you were seen
oft have i prais'd them as they stalk'd along
observe their haunt and watch with jealous care
their humble texture weave but most delight
regards wellpleas'd whatever works excel
was kindling torches to obscure the sun
do they not oft with kind accession flow
his sprightly air and glossy dye
founded on honour wilkes is still himself
with impious hand the sacred vestment shred
the laugh which more than censure wounds
at sight of that sequester'd glade
in language plain as was his dress
receive my sayings with a stedfast ear
his horse and him unconscious of them all
how swift our active spirits urge their way
your gifts your honours dance around my strain
from heracleum on the mountain's highth
what lengths of farfamed ages billow'd high
was vanquish'd by the spleen
beyond the proud oppressor's cruel grasp
yet wants the honour injur'd to defend
resounding thro' the olive shade
or hear the summon with an idle gaze
their interest like a lion lives on prey
the steel of brutus burst the grosser bonds
his honest friends at thirsty hour of dusk
beneath the myrtle grove inspir'd my lays
but that disease when soberly defin'd
shou'd melt his resolution down
before my lips shall breathe the impartial vow
hark orpheus strikes the lyre again
by mercers lacemen mantuamakers press'd
thy resistless martial legions
books pictures statues here we find
i know your brother loves the beauteous maid
that corfe and kingston gentry think you mad
but keep me mild as when love first began
from all the hamlet cull'd whom best i lov'd
in every liquid there's a constant rowl
secure from each unhallow'd eye
in that sweet season when the mounting sun
why praise we prodigal of fame
of ceres bacchus andi the athenian maid
drops his weak wing and sighs his soul away
but one more smart than all the rest
and only virtue's friends be yours
themselves with bellying goblets nor when spring
made every climate your's and every soil
o'erlook the failure all offend that live
or shall we touch that kind access of joy
nor find defence nor charter there
sigh not ye winds as passing o'er
and but that thou art incorp'rate with the flame
when hunger call'd they left the wood
proud gallia treacherously brave
observing how they spoke with rancour
that blooms and withers in an hour
lead stern depopulation in her train
the prattling streams and zephyrs bland
before the surgeons brib'd these rogues
the pasture gay no hurtful weeds be found
its high vicegerency in future time
behold the saxon cas'd in mailf
instruct them to pursue the unerring print
too happy to be long admir'd
bright cythera the fair
lark linnet thrush and thou of all the grove
behold thyself reflected here
we cannot 'tis impossible to part
to be the slave of greatness to strike sail
then clad in weeds of woe i see thee come
while that sells best that's most against the law
the butler hanging down his head
while stars by conscious twinklings seem'd to know
view'd a deliv'rer with disdain and hate
improve the kind occasion understand
a fatal harvest on the deck
expecting soon the friendlyfurious wave
active strength and cunning sleight
they urge the traveller's common chance
mistress of the vocal song
and recompense our cares
the ripen'd harvst now demands your care
behind and strikes them from the book of life
hides his grim aspect from the sight of men
now the shrill cornpipes echoing loud to arms
whose latrant stomachs oft molest
and rustic battle ends the boobies 'broil
where she presides all must be nobly great
thy wisdom's empty boast
where your great master's orb his planets where
oft inadvertent by the boiling stream
sweet groves i love your silent shades
for when the body oft expiring lies
since yet the glorious name of orange stands
who not to sleep allow'd the needful time
forming of life artciviliz'd the bond
awakes the kindling ray
as often wish his tedious race was run
and ever musing on the common weal
he had not time to feel in town
burst from the pallid sickly sky
reach the blest seats and waft our tender woe
the moorish squadron to the capital
to them the sounding jargon of the schools
o haste to me while o'er thy way she strews the fairest flowers
first tun'd the british harp and little deem'd
will not affront me and no other can
i from this picture plainly see
at first thinwavering till at last the flakes
upon the least appearance of relief
not all the storms that shake the pole
who had so sweetly shone she seem'd 'till now
ah do not yet give o'er thy plaintive lay
and sense by right divine ascends the throne
the murd'rous zeal of a weak romishp queen
and phoebus fiercely twangs the sprightly lyre
and austria scourg'd o'er all the subject seas
the noble spirit that in dangers brave
when chance revers'd the prosp'rous day
and last of vulgar tribes a countless crowd
could fetch from records of an earlier age
shook a white shower from the blackthorn bush
i curs'd the cause that forc'd him to expire
in boundless walks of raptured thought where gods
but ah what daedal hand can trace
to loftier chambers of the deep
weigh anchor spread thy sails call every wind
no busy steps the grassgrown footway tread
and here in tinctur'd wool we now behold
and see his conscience ripp'd with steady eye
beheld a thousand temples rise
to distant nations or with sov'ran sway
purge thou my heart with hyssop lest like cain
a phantom brighter than the blaze of day
who sav'd a nation than who nations won
unequal fate his fall without his guilt
not from the burnets oldmixons and cooks
she from whose pensive and mellifluous throat
have each a med'cine for the rustic mind
to raise my vernal joys conspire
what numbers sheath'd in erudition lie
'from better habitations spurn'd
were sons indeed they felt a filial heart
that you yourself being extant well might show
'tis good 'tis pleasant through th' advancing year
so swam achilles fierce and brave
as that immortal flame you've rais'd in me
but now the roses from her cheeks were flown
their portraiture in the inverted heaven
the pure beverage of the bee
and rest in dead contraction lost
't was his at cards each novice to trepan
with downcast streaming eyes
his appetite unanswer'd by his pow'r
who smiles each happy day possest
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
but are not criticks to their judgment too
so near proud rhodes across the raging flood
this image on the medal place'd
fair emblems of your mistress 'breast
renounces wisdom's sullen pomp
more bright than streams of fluid silver are
and leaning on her faithful breast
she there shall dress a sweeter sod
fierce partyrage each village fires
haste haste he lies in wait he's at the door
and thou fair indian whose immense domain
the glare of courts and luxury of state
thy smiles all human sorrows mock
comes lagging like a distanc'd horse
thy frozen floods delight no more
of past delight calls forth his beauteous bride
decrepid age nor that from harvey nam'd
but vice whose face is ever bare
impatient to devour
medon pisander and a hundred more
the warlike wodehouse march'd with prowest might
the soft fallacious gleam of hope and turns
his pow'rful works his daily praise renew
the unequivocal authentic deed
now sinks in everlasting night
and on the virgin cast a parting eye
with glaring eyeballs cross our way
betray thea founder of messiah's line
and bids alphonso by a sep'rate course
for all they had to live upon was grief
this could not be the lure of beasts of prey
there peaceful shades yon conscious grove
say must the muse th' unwilling task pursue
the generous almoner of health
the most gigantic sons of earth the broad
what tho' at the imagin'd tale
reclin'd a studied carelessness express'd
while chalky cliffs o'erlook the shaded deep
as the soft touch dissolv'd the virginzone
the boy abash'd and half afraid
she shook her head its meaning well i knew
the rest are on the wing how fleet their flight
thef lively image of his father's grace
then oft well pleas'd with them retire
points out what merits praise what merits blame
torn out and blotted from the list of fame
shadow and sunshine intermingling quick
this bleeding heart would know no smarting pain
to combat atheists with in modern days
if you would learn death's character attend
weeps tears of joy and bursts into a song
and while she stands abash'd with conscious eye
on her resolves the western world relies
for fix'd or worth her thought this rolling ball
from hecatombs by heroes slain
for thou hast long liv'd in my heart
o'er those fair lawns to pour a sanguine flood
her bosom with the raging passion burns
from ev'ry window and the fields are green
weighs more than ages of renown
then o'er the sanded valley floating spreads
i should deserve to forfeit all applause
moral or intellectual more intense
ye borderers on the coasts of bliss what are you
nor kill with frown severe one harmless lyar
but if they own ingenuous virtue's sway
they call'd them out by two and three
no matron ever sweetly sung
now man revives and smile the worlds around
and the tears tremble in the languid eye
where revels frantic folly
ye swains now hasten to the hazelbank
one song employs all nations and all cry
have met with proofs beyond denial
his grandeur in the heavens the sun and moon
becomes a dicebox and a billiard mast
or friendship's band or hymen's sacred chain
our time is wealth no frugal hand can store
rather than not blast thine he'll blast his own
soft sigh'd the flute the tender voice was heard
what meant that god which still methinks i view
her soul to gain a mistress and a slave
alone the wanton mischief he pursues
and wanton fish shall leave their native seas
in emerald groves and shadowy glades
swift as the gale fly o'er the rolling seas
rush on the eye and crowd upon the sight
nursing her daughter arts majestic stood
he had a frank and pleasant look
printed and praised in every magazine
thou who awak'st fair stella's soothing lay
before the silent masters of the world
nor these alone were found incloister'd here
bid that cold bosom cold no more
the pris'ner blush'd the muses frown'd
when ruin threaten'd me of late
others extended naked on the floor
and little eelets soon begin to creep
whilst principals ungrac'd like lacquies wait
and with a nod that shook the spheres he swore
in arts and sciences in wars and peace
and satiate of his journey thinks of home
unnumber'd pictures fleeting o'er the brain
were kings elective realms would sue
and own the monarch heav'n vouchsafes to own
whether in shepherd's cleanly weed
and yelp'd and leap'd delighted to attend
all hope of marriage lost in her disgrace
trees half obscuring columns intervene
urg'd by necessity had roam'd the dark
grandeur a bubble honours empty all
conceal'd you sported in the secret shade
of things external acts in different ways
my earliest flame to whom i owe
as subject to times love or to times hate
beheld the wanton cities of the plain
look down much honour'd shade below
bless me and by repentance make
o then denounce thy sovereign will
tir'd with contempt she quits the slipp'ry reign
luscious nectar's quintessence
or conquer in their country's cause
so from our dust fresh faculties may bloom
and all the present world shall be no more
where vice triumphant rears aloft her head
for well i ween thou hear'st my doleful song
speak of the spring and foison of the year
in adria weds his greenhair'd bride
his station too it seems is hard as thine
and now to heaven unnumber'd sighs she sends
if there he flies for help with sudden yawn
but find me wrapt in meditations high
of yonder doleful passingbell
of dogs quickmouth'd and shouts that mingle loud
upon their shoes the romans wore
but railing railing friend it ne'er can do
fear less love on you need not dye like him
mine be the friend less frequent in his pray'rs
hard hard command and yet i will obey
thy deeds theb conquest of the world inspire
dishonest triumphs and ignoble spoils
cramm'd to the throat in lazy plenty yawn
and trembling under complicated pains
to make dejected virtue nobly rise
from guile the heart too honest to suspect
his life shall blazon or his memory crown
despondence this dull melancholy's scene
with her warm bosom rising to the throbs
warm at my heart new hopes dilate
campbell foretold just what he wou'd
is wise in man as if an angel spoke
felt those gusts which since prevail
and mine this stroke shall free
ripe mellow heaps from ev'ry tree are shook
with phlegmatick resolves and dry discourse
of more exalting suns let asia's woods
then hagley mourn your genius fled
serving with looks his sacred majesty
exhorts them still to foul revolt alas
that feels for injured love but i disdain
where his revenge or favour shall be shown
too sure my father's injur'd ghost would rise
and tells them as he strokes their silver locks
sweats swoonings and convulsive motions
of nations conquer'd and of worlds undone
or rich bermudas' balmy isle
richmond his generous soul resign'd
now by the voice of his experience true
is but a false agreeable design
where on hard beds the porous spunges grow
so shall my dear my lov'd belinda find
but death and hell subdu'd the deity
i sit me down a pensive hour to spend
inglorious sunk them in a watry grave
to snatch the liquid treasures from thy arm
no lavish flowers were ever strew'd
and kindle at the poet's fire
a temperate sunshine and an air serene
and all with one afrighting blaze is inconfusion lost
'till celia answer'd with a smile
in public rage all private love was sunk
and in their train to fill the press
instruction are thy words and lively truth
and with applause thro' ev'ry couple run
the rays that radiate from thy cloudless sphere
their ravisht hearts what earning transports move
of patriots and of heroes but if doom'd
no less a slave than they each rumour shakes
but first our powerful realms obey
and their first league again take place
while parties rage o truth with honest zeal
to these reflections each slow wearing day
of various cadence and his sportive lambs
she condescends to listen to his pray'r
i bow'd again oh speak if thou art he
and set the planets by the ears
'or grieve for friendship unreturn'd
yet he alone to ev'ry scene could give
and gives sylvanus empire in the main
for man to howl in why not his abode
thy pristine glory thy unmatch'd renown
at night returning every labour sped
lorenzo pride repress nor hope to find
we trust him not too far king though he be
tho' now confin'd within this castre
this carries friendship to her noontide point
they reach'd a grassy plain which from the skirts
and glittering hang o'er borrowdale
by all the prophets all th' apostles sung
should'st thou coarse boors or gloomy martyrs see
and loose example whom he should instruct
thy pitying aid o god impart
for in their heaps was no resisting atoms found
he knock'd was usher'd to the room of state
lorenzo no the thought of death indulge
just made fifth chaplain of his patron lord
by heaven supplied with future stores of health
circling thro' pendant cliffs and watery dales
for now their godships recollected
those authors wit and sense said she
and from the mystick cloud reveals
swells in the breeze and with the hasty tread
and live or die between 'em
and lavish'd all my little store

and meekey'd hope and inward peace

to reach coy learning's lofty seat
his twisted spires or stretch his lengthen'd train
and reigns sole mistress in his breast

the mighty plan oracular in verse
fair truth a hallow'd guide inspires my song
oppreffion nam'd and stretch'd her filthy claw
o he was lovely fair as purest snow
but to be pent within the walls
such rare exceptions shining in the dark
thine the unborrow'd gems of thought
plum'd conceit himself surveying
no human sound but their own pensive tones
then to the shades of learned ease retir'd
give me to chuse see gotham's ruin'd state
like vapours steeming from a sulph'rous cell
imprest with agincourt's emblazon'd name
or roving join fantastic pleasure's train
the neighb'ring kings his great allies engag'd
to stipulate for half mankind
but you perhaps are by the ear
blest be the man his memory at least
brave troops by whom as heaven protecting led
with a hot pasty or a warden pye
and sounds angelic echo thro' the glade
around their fields the yam i taught to grow
so take my judgment in his language dress'd
as human nature's broadest foulest blot
with happiness and glory fraught
foulded your tender arms and slept agen
what when to raise the meditated scene
invoke to their infernal bower
while the great bard sublimest truths explor'd
the gallant vessel with its hapless crew

and rais'd towards that heav'n which now allow'd

with modest talents and a feeling heart

attentive to the wise the great of soul
by any change of fortune proof alike
what tho' nor glittering turret rise
slaves fight for what were better cast away
and cooks had nature's judgment set aside
sip the fresh dews and in the sunshine play
and cantium's plains beneath the appennine
dost ask me when when he who died returns
had more of strength diviner rage
the nodding plumes around his temples wave
and great design against th' oppressive load
a numerous offspring lovely like themselves
and man corrupts the blessings meant by heav'n
hence oft' to win some stubborn maid
his own exploits with boastful glee he told
but now they watch their lordies' frowns
can send remembrance back to fetch
'twould tire me ev'n to count their number o'er
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
the pious christian thinks not worth his care
with brutal hand from his contending arms
when phoebus mounts his early car
a diamond buckle blazed his breast before
which stands upon that rising mountain's side
and fled such wisdom like trophonius' cave
more lov'd more known and justly more admir'd
the boast and wonder of the plain
one deepfelt pang would pierce the dullest heart
its fount the grand authority of heaven
they ask the price of each unrivall'd steed
and higher relish than meridian suns
the mazes and the brambles vex
but lurks and sneaks at home
anon with slackened rage comes quivering down
indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good
with all the monstrous progeny of nile
combine and deepening into night shut up
thou should'st like me bewail thy lot
attend the goddess thro' her airy scene
and let your comment be the mantuan muse
what fancy's sketching power can do
but let them both his favours share
when diff'rent passions draw the wedded pair
is heard and all in tears he wakes again
each supple limb she swaith'd and tender bone
by musick minds an equal temper know
yet here shall faithful love the maiden save
liberal and rich a plenteous board he spread
they met they laugh'd as goy and i may do
while wing'd with mirth the laughing minutes glide
that melted to their fluid state again

and howl and roar as likes them uncontroul'd

and simple truth miscalld simplicity
her dusky mantle and the god of day
invested with a keen diffusive sky
for av'rice rising from the caves of earth
and one vast object fills my aching sight
streams of dissolving rime no longer glide
the comforts which from labour flow
from far the beauteous syrian roses glow
her lessons teach to swell the capon's size
' clap that within and see how they will wear '
in awful schemes the management of states
why really couz the sage rejoin'd
i'll tell thee fairest of all women how
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
god never made a husband king or wife
his heat intense and on his vitals prey'd
diseases rise from being bound
nor ceaseless toils for sordid gains
and flavia sure must be sincere
and pour'd her soul into my ear
the troubled mind's fantastick dress
o that you now with genius at command
or in circaean bower
nor carp at ev'ry flaw you may discern
suppose the accusation justly brought
or by necessity constrain'd they live
when the sad soul by care and grief oppress'd
pale trembling from her steed she fled
and squeezes out his eyes and twangs his vocal nose
to trace the sacred paths with hallowed feet
as cuma's maid when by the god inspir'd
thousand distastes t'allay thy envy'd gains
sink ye swelling tides of song
or views his coffers with suspicious eyes
who bravely perish'd for a thankless state
selim had had them ev'ry one
it pauses now and now with rising knell
and without thought survey thy memorable wound
he heard her latest sigh
not drowsy beings that till noontide pours
they most the world enjoy who least admire
nor can she add nor can i suffer more
that ev'n a judgment making way for thee
he dwells within his own unfathom'd essence
why turns you villain pale why bends his eye
on what green medal virtue stands express'd
but that she fasts and item goes to church
the law of england to controul and awe
a regal breast has levell'd to the ground
and the weak fear of being right alone
how false is man nor recollects his vows
and angel choirs attended wond'ring stood
have nobler tasks assign'd
who quit true bliss to grasp an empty toy
the most supine this snatches man from death
stay nor to beauty's urn thy tears refuse
and hear the sweeping torrent roar
where tenerif's thy stateliness today
as if some pow'rful charm he would infuse
but tosses thro' the midnightshade
they demideify and fume him so
heav'n turns from with abhorrence and disdain
my father's spirit hovers near
thy crowded temples where thou sit'st enshrin'd
even where the madness of the straiten'd streams
desir'd nor wanted diligent to learn
time creeps unconscious of delight
is all our whole of happiness full proof
but ah how chang'd the falling poor remains
that lurks within the smallest flower
by gentle means he yet his end would gain
and take with simple pensions simple praise
it brings us more than triple aid an aid
like day and night humility and pride
commits her eggs incautious to the dust
of rude magnificence your solemn rest
that will not perish and that cannot cloy
make sophocles disguis'd in english speak
through which his halfwak'd soul would faintly peep
and once a week at least is read
that dupery of sense
impregnated with horror soon will pour
for their support so destitute but they
contempt and fury fire their souls by turns
for sure no minutes bring us more content
and thus by heav'n's mighty monarch vow
this lent a face divinely fair
it happen'd on a sultry day
to emulate a generous warmth implies
than this and endless age in groans resound
tho' held by all the force and fraud of spain
suggests a thousand times that's all betray'd
and deems the crimes of man beneath his cares
art thou ashamed to bend thy knee to heaven
if bus'ness calls them to some distant place
pursu'd with equal speed the flying deer
the juicy tide a twining mass of tubes
would speak on either side or both
for every line can boast an ardent tear
tho' long you sported have with cupid's dart
most likes it when he studies it in town
in courts and gilded roofs some loose the bands
aurora to the muses still is kind
when nurs'd by careless solitude i liv'd
its bergamot or aids th' indebted eye
to deck some tavern vile at auctions sold
he's ridicul'd for that he but affected
o let me now when the kind early dew
fair fancy waking at the sound
to plant the soul on her eternal guard
a wither'd laurel and a mould'ring arch
felt it his pride his comfort to complain
with weekly daily hourly libels cloath'd
the throbs the anguish of a breaking heart
yet when the sun no more appears
would trouble him much more
a cucumber while costly yet and scarce
with starts of rage and aim oblique
of poverty that thus he may procure
and languid spots declining vigour tell
with marks of pow'r and regal ensigns grac'd
no more by servile prejudice confin'd
i hear you have ten thousand pound
alas i rave and sue for new deceit
uninjured with inimitable art
when to the empty'd throne i boldly rose
the wounds which now each moment bleed
and while they murmur strive in vain to sleep
a constellation of ten thousand gems
to cheer you thro' life's thorny way
then let not fancy with her vagrant blaze
we learn says she from good st paul
lull'd by the lapse of gliding floods
and when i die be sure you let me know
interior on his coat then creeps along
i might be happy and not break my vow
and perspective it is the painters art
th' intent of heav'n thus rightly understood
brings power and wealth to grace her lover's side
the varied couch of sweet repose
i've lost a day the prince who nobly cried
who first should sing te deum
for tho' deprav'd and sunk she brought thee forth
yet cou'd not be inform'd where he might find
untainted down from sire to son
in ev'ry party found and yet of none
again as fancy points the way
the marks of pow'r divine
'twas not a taste but pow'rful mode that bade
i cannot reconcile your fancies
her lovely form deceives the heart
hail innocence whose bosom all serene
yet enter madam and resume your sway
and beg'd he'd tell 'em if he knew
for as he upwards gazing lay
with lies enough to make a lord asham'd
and shelter from the blast in vain we hope
is bright with spouting rills the vital stream
and while they make the fortune lose the friend
new grace to each fair object thou'dst impart
repentant saw the close of mortal day
when from thy sight i waste the tedious day
yet tho' abroad the wanton roam
let this great maxim be my action's guide
down to the last and best of his few restless days
with mention of a spouse
and there fresh verdure cloaths the pastur'd plain
dark thoughts presages fell and comfortless despair
true greatness wisdom virtue hence must rise
to visit the new world and strait to feel
bards may be lords but 'tis not in the cards
and view that person as your mortal foe
a beau is but an ass
and shook with indignation at the sound
high poiz'd above his nest in air
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
which thy own heart perhaps would better tell
with all the fiercer tortures of the mind
nothing is dead but what encumber'd gall'd
into a perfect calm that not a breath
to gather balm of choicest dews
rekindling every joy with tenfold force
was it in lux'ry to dissolve the span
see'st thou the limpid current glide
whereat his horse did snort as he
his lov'd elvira grows so grave
nor would endure that any should controul
delicious draughts the quinces now or plums
of ductile piety becomes their tool
counting large heaps of o'erabounding good
his threat'ning lance a hornet's horrid sting
the peaceful echoes undisturb'd with sound
when now no friendly look was left
verse in the finest mould of fancy cast
while as the thunder's awful sound
prop'd by their care or strengthen'd by their blood
or in the covert of a wood
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
and such is thine my friend intent to save
what regions part the world of soul
what tho' the dome be wanting whose proud gate
what sacred rapture in our bosom glows
that wish accomplish'd why the grave of bliss
above the reach of wild ambition's wind
in which ten thousand thousand labours join
a pestilential sow a meazel'd pork
till from dissensions concords rise
in every wind victorious thunders roll
but turning next he saw a dreadful sight
though nature's terrors thus may be repress'd
it is his royal image makes it pass
that much encumber'd had the way
no cries attempt the mercies of the skies
her train upheld by twenty noble maids
i love thee so that i would calmly bear
with love and freedom wit and joy
besides if failings at the bottom lie
prepares it for its ruin hardens blinds
are you poor boys at school today
the weak have remedies the wise have joys
take god from nature nothing great is left
this said no more appear'd the beauteous maid
thou lately didst attempt to reach my speed
with temperance in the rural cell
dissolv'd in her kind arms transported lay
could i be conscious of a crime so base
while these remain a base but constant breed
and loudly sound ye chosen aid my people
are the refreshless fields their arid hue
while love usurp'd the tears to virtue due
that i have luck must friend and foe confess
prevent the axe and grace thy end
are all the nameless sweets of friendship fled
where wellworn slaves obsequious to the call
and fill'd and rapt each selfaccusing soul
but first she makes the spouse himself disarm
at length the longdisputed pass they gain
far as th' almighty stretch'd his utmost line
reflect that lodg'd within its breast
fly or i'll send you back without a groat
again thy spirit fill the comic stage
shrink from that empire o'er the conquer'd feas
and eat drink study sleep as it may fall
without thy aid without thy gladsome beams
'twas then illusion's ready hand
tow'rds the black vein a passage cleaves
while free they hung upon my pensive brow
if maevius scribble in apollo's spight
too late he look'd for friendship's aid
the parts all bruis'd in racking torture swell
are plac'd each other's beams to share
but weak of wing on planets perch'd and thought
why from thy cheek the wonted crimson flies
resounds for ever in th' abstracted ear
whose mercy deign'd to spare
on ev'ry pleasing accent wisdom hung
that hung the bright palladium of the place
and prompt his talents to a better part
and all the great ideas fade and die
each youth shall spurn at slav'ry's abject reign
when in her blooming loveliness arrayed
with golden characters her worth engrave
thus blest with children friend and wife
and helpless hangs sweetsmiling on the knee
who hear the bird of midnight's song
space for his horses equipage and hounds
the more severely on my age to frown
be still indulgent to my father's age
here instant darkness shrouds thy genial bloom
my drooping heart confess'd a dreadful void
and thy last lustres darken in the shade
rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey
are fit the authour of such flights to praise
they lurk enshrouded in the veil of night
with bashful forehead thro' the cool moist air
to use the powers assign'd her active strength
when raging tempests cloud the sky
more elevated poignant and refin'd
what can advance in these degenerate days
the tender thought on thee shall dwell
unbiass'd truth your virtues friend
the female sex with sweet attractive airs
tenacious hold nor will the dwelling leave
in vain now sings now heaves the desp'rate sigh
oh would you paint his lordship's jerkin o'er
and lye without a blush without a smile
while by the taper's trembling light
behold her demigods in senate met
and dost thou ahaz judah's scourge disgrace
yclept thes lily of the vale
him tubal named the vulcan of old times
the weak interpreters of mortal thoughts
he threw his bloodstain'd sword in thunder down
he at fit periods walks through aries
to catch renown by ruining mankind
and in whose life alone she seem'd to live
to shops in crouds the dagged females fly
tie up my sleeves with ribbons rare
much better if agreeing with your own
a nation up in arms tho' strong not proud
is there no patron to protect the muse
ye virgins tread with cautious feet
and cheer the anxious moments of thy end
may fire the belgians in the field of mars
or where the sun with downward torrid ray
we think the person who enjoys so much
or wrap himself in hamlet's inky cloak
tow'ring aloft upon the glitt'ring plain
free from those ills that haunt their pamper'd lord
nor let me with a vain and idle eye
but rushing swiftly from her stoic heights
that site and figure are as foreign quite
while ripen'd fruits and milder seasons last
receiv'd per me's the only stile
with rocks and bushes fenc'd on either side
whom painted with bandeau you see
the warrioriron nor the peaceful less
th' impetuous nerve of passion urges on
tho' murm'ring rills invite him to repose
but all the wide creation nature gave
the draught of life is mixt at best
no more shall these fond eyes delight
and by the glances of her magic eye
but just to nature own thy forming hand
congratulates his bliss who would not leave
what then am i
now charm'd i hear the bold corneille inspire
a sculptor to indulge her thought
whose talent chiefly is to write
nor knows a wish that heaven can refuse
you shun the shelving roof and tread
nought like their home the constant lobsters prize
by giving glows as on pure winter's eve
the bed of flora on the branch is made
that man divine by whom were sown
that courts the fancy or that wins the heart
intolerable day yet in their coats
the proud highborn patrician whore
the soft access of evercircling joys
thus dying swans are said to sing
in glory's active courts delights to dwell
to climb unprun'd and wild the juicy grape
best pities lovers and best sings of love
drops from our locks or trickles down our face
her rites all paid in order due
and which a masterhand alone can reach
nor thou musaeus from thine ear discard
consuming fevers rage no more
and their repeated wonders shake the dome
then strive no more to win a simple maid
in highest heaven is rear'd
her shepherd cheer'd of her enamour'd less
a soul devoid of art
farther than we that eye of heaven discerns
you live and in whose aweful presence stand
oercharged with burden of mine own loves might
that absence is no cure for love
were task'd to his full strength absorb'd and lost
the radiant virtues progeny divine
descend ye nine descend and sing
he that would win the race must guide his horse
has lost its beauties and its pow'rs
ah give not pity 'tis akin to love
and did a thousand glorious things in vain
the bodkin comb and essence to prepare
that sought with anxious tenderness to save
o seize again thy golden quill
raise ye fair structures raise your towery head
for huffing braggart puft nobility
from mute shellfish gasping on the shore
to high atchievements can your spirits bend
how bright beneath the bush it glows
you'll raise in me no jealous fears
the pious office unperform'd he left
the beasts unable to sustain
marks melancholy's reign
august how bright thy golden scenes appear
our haughty norman boasts that barb'rous name
while free and fine the bride's appear below
books useless lumber yet in embryo slept
the leek with crown globose and reedy stem
then jupiter held traffick with the earth
know death shall lock thy stiff'ning frame
and sweetly cheer'd i know not how
which o'er primroses pale she sheds
let order peace and housewif'ry be mine
and thus augments the chillness of the night
the bride's attendance and the bridal song
in crowds behind to guard me to my coach
what thence i suffer'd let high heav'n declare
' than here to herd with country clown or squire
'tis more to guide than spur the muse's steed
by frequent converse with familiar death
and great in reputation grown
the present transitory hour
his verse with tuneful fable rung
first for strict duty bids my care extend
o'er the plains extended wide
and quench the noble thirst of fame
in fancied majesty or from his cell
taught her the savage nature to forget
with unavailing voice this toilsome scene
immortal ages past yet nothing gone
the fluttering pulse of life now ceas'd to play
his lavish carols wont to sing
in bad preeminence conspicuous shone
and every step with cautious terror makes
thou talk'st of holy ties and rules severe
then hear aloof the human tempest beat
who has not heard of fam'd xantippe's lute
or by base blund'ring statesmen sent to jail
say will your tutors give you time
but when you knock it never is at home
make him athletic as in days of old
an union with the vast terraqueous whole
broad o'er the south hangs at his utmost noon
pallas descended from the realms of light
th' ear piercing hern and plover screaming high
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
i on a time from columbel did get
no doth he purpose its salvation no
that lead me to the thorny maze
her cupid lov'd whom psyche lov'd again
i wish wish on thou gentle maid
and lo a tall majestic maid
what insectmyriads seek the summer skies
wishing for war but willing to be bought
the belgian host while we survey'd our own
for to live single too and then they may
to thee serenest solitude
with nothing less th' aspiring soul's content
whereon she sits and hears from either pole
to hear 'em rail at honest sd
th' inspiring genius she in melting lays
her votaries what avails from iron chains
the strange reserve the proud affected state
such were the working thoughts which swell'd the breast
tho' spenser's elegance and dryden's fire
its wealth in tributary rills
yet cherubs sing and so shou'd we
gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease
for powerful as thy sword from thy rich tongue
flies thick in amorous chace and wanton rolls
their gen'rous strife and greatly to perform
but hark the groves rejoice the forest rings
but ah the cruel glass between
tho' trembling each seraphic sound decay
when ceres led me thro' her wheaten mines
to mimick rural life and soothe some vapour'd fair
oh charming paradise of short liv'd sweets
the happy lover to his blooming bride
why not permitted i to do the like
be thou content with emma's heart
by heaven's peculiar care
the daedal soils of earth produce
pants to communicate her noble fires
the peer's disease in turn attacks the clown
when thou appearest lovely maid
with powerless wings around them wrapt expire
while wisdom shines with light divine
rush'd in distraction to his daughter's chamber
as roam'd a pilgrim o'er the mountain drear
were made to many an author's praise
but heav'n has sent me here to save your lives
trade in the blood of innocence and plead
justice the scale of interest for the whole
studious to cheat and eager to beguile
'tis this which makes all europe's business known
his wond'ring hearers learn and ever keep
her flavio them alone might hear
most easily dispense
a foreigner long since whose nobler mind
to gaze and sigh and think my self undone
while your rich fruit time might mature
'twas thine for others woes to melt
and many a cross she makes and many a bead lets fall
and now the british fleets in southern seas
though intervolved exact and pointing out
nor the vain itch t'admire or be admir'd
to bring her recollection to the point
'i'd gladly be of use to you
ye bloom'd thro' time's long flight unknown
for the long night and distant far his home
and though th' almighty maker has throughout
vain scorn will aggravate distress
what force wou'd guard him from the lion's jaw
not prone to blame not hasty to commend
and with vain pride insult the seeming dead
and swept with hurried hand the strings
secure in yonder vale their fleecy breed
in prayer she was employ'd which instant taught me
why colin dost thou wear that pensive look
and whilst she scratch'd her lover into rest
has lost its relish grand mistake of fools
a blaze that lights us to our shame
philosopher divine and poet join'd
he cannot hear the praise or mitigate the pain
as their own property their lawful prey
and smiles eternal from her candid eyes
written in gold let revolution stand
victorious this our other world subdu'd
and which no care can obviate it were long
gorgonius sits abdominous and wan
but ah in vain no change of time or place
for scorn to sport with such then is th'abode
this you ocelia by experience find
permit a mortal to unveil his mind
but fancied men with times might change
who shrink to rob the insect of its hour
perhaps the happiest of the sons of men
then let the wicked fear
names thee mars and bids thee call
one meal or shelter for one moment there
where long i liv'd a farmer's happy wife
ah who by genius bless'd yet curs'd by fate
where petrarch mourn'd and laura trod
flew o'er his head and plough'd the distant ground
serve as a key to those that are suppress'd
fixt sudden they the numming torpor feel
one thought of him contracts it all again
no robber comes that preys on weaker shoals
that dwells beneath thy altar and from thence
that thus infects your seabegirted isle
and hail them as the dear abodes of peace
all was tempestuous din on every side
the quirks and crotchets of outrageous fancy
something which jars upon and hurts the mind
or empire whether in thy dawn of youth
'are trifling and decay
ten thousand forms ten thousand different tribes
where man by nature fierce has laid aside
but lost my bosom's sweet content
officious jealousy renews my pain
in vain i view'd you with as chaste a fire
she nothing of the case beforehand knew
quickens our spirit's movement for an hour
yet love is sure the sov'reign flow'r
his wings than lillies whiter to behold
keen scanning deep that smites the guilty soul
to turn the furrow nor mechanic hand
to bid our sweetest passions die
full famous in romantick tale when he
or thinks he hath to verse shall make pretence
sternly she look'd and stern began
around the bowl let myrtles twine
they lay pour'd out in ease and luxury
and despicably poor they range the field
feeds ev'ry sense
your virtue wears a vail like others crimes
that to the begging crew it was confin'd
shall make the rough way smooth the crooked straight
something we had not known and could not know
dshall the same cause which prompts the chatt'ring jay
extremes are dang'rous plac'd on either side
not such the hermit's needy cell bestows
produce the mighty bowl the mighty bowl
and adds his rapture to the gen'ral praise
a dream how dreadful universal blank
save where you are how happy you make those
why with such warmth her charms you prais'd
good sense their pleasure virtue still their guide
enjoyed spare feast a radish and an egg
this happy hour repays osmida's found
be dumb fond maid thy sacred ink nor spill
with open murmurs own their loves
and see me languish for the melting bliss
and you whose souls are held
and peaceful pass your hours away
to scenes where taste and genius dwell
i show'd you islands yet unknown to men
when from a neighbouring hawthorn in whose shade
the glory of his land and age
to where the violet fades into the sky
and thus in pow'r unrival'd dolphins reign
and own'd with no unwilling tongue
hast lost thy pipe or is thy garland dead
all these i've known and now i fly
but when octavius had the nations freed
can't rule their giddy thoughts nor stem the coming tide
when none sought hair in realms unknown
tox willing indians deals our equal laws
the trackless wheelings of the swallow's flight
warning the cookmaid not to burn
for some lov'd book prevents the rising day
but what the coldest must approve
pencil'd with gold and streak'd with azure veins
and see thy hand the dagger raise
the trojans fell in hector's fall
so the grand whale will court the weedy strand
and thou as careless and forlorn as they
and teach the mortal mind to glow
his fate he merits as to rebels due
on whose fair birth the graces mild
but who is he whom later garlands grace
till drunk with blessings they despis'd their god
and pours her sorrows o'er the form she grasps
and often journey'd round the ample board
with rapid force they fly and from the ship
can there be any such you call his foes
a colony from heaven or only raised
which falls descending to his wealthy heir
my sober ev'ning let the tankard bless
by every art that science could devise
with tiresome sameness in his ears resound
dthe speaker when the commons are assembled
a heart magnanimous the men of kent
my charms are native innocence at most
free as the air they cut sip'd purest rills
from all a father's love
bear frequent vials pregnant with the dregs
his words they flow wi' gracefu' ease
as with her philomela she
a hummingbird once made its bed
and just in his account why bird and beast
to future periods in idea all
nor fasten'd thus could he uncurl again
let us suppose octavia may be wrong
not all the offerings of the hours
on sleds reclin'd the furry russian sits
and 'tis her prudence makes her soul confin'd
in some are such resistless graces found
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
the shady walk tempts on my wandering feet
but i nought strive poor colin to compare
slow to the vault they come with heavy tread
when lovely thy creation wakes
'till the first dawn of that eternal light
new scenes of beauty each succeeds
unskill'd my twofold nature to divide
and kindly half the pleasing burthen bear
when purblind reason's deem'd the surest guide
thou alpha and omega of the whole
he takes and by one efficacious breath
th' immortal progeny of jove unfolds
with gibbets bones and carcases defil'd
e'en giles for all his cares and watchings past
the pow'rs of fancy and strong thought are theirs
as if my former sufferings were too small
your equal doings then for ever spake
where sainted myriads crowd the joyful choir
here faithful memory wakens all her powers
its little joys go out by one and one
and bid the melancholly moments smile
where heated fancy forms the flatt'ring scheme
here hold your revels and make this your home
nor knows the charms of truth her bosom beats
thro' the green glens where lucid deva flows
such wreaths their temples crown as greece entwin'd
whilst eagerly i catch the golden sound
'tis true our sex has been from early time
dire were the strain and dissonant to sing
if ever soul ascended had he dropp'd
be more than french on ev'ry country call
thy first can but for moments sever
thus in a double sense the good are wise
struck by my aim fall shrieking to the ground
so may nor spleen nor envy blast thy name
assist our flight fame's flight is glory's fall
and if some grudging souls be here
where drought incumbent on the thirsty ground
that crowns it yet not all its pride secures
bavaria rival of his fame
on chance necessity and fate
the nursery of men for future years
that bought the font and i repair'd the pews
come peace of mind delightful guest
and by a murmuring stream supinely lay
the devil's in't they don't agree
the twilight is no more no doubtful gleams
the leading cynosure that glow'd
and soft amasia was her name
and romping extasy 'gin play
and seine hung trembling o'er her wasted urn
soft maids and village hinds shall bring
her beauty much but more her merit shines
where liberty maintains her latest stand
the prophet's voice and wrap his soul in fire
hang his lank jaws and scowl despair
a hundred sons and not one fop
and wakes the tears i love to shed
bids admiration all its incense pour
thou fairest daughter of the various year
who distant bounds to rolling waves assign'd
whence sprung this glorious frame or when began
i whipp'd her blushing on thy father's knee
her daughters decked most daintily i see
to yonder stars for other ends they shine
which make the goodness of your mind appear
but for the substance still the shade pursue
the cruel world is not my friend
hygeia well can witness she who saves
with all their flippant fluency of tongue
and your authority is't regal
and careless of th' event withdrew
and through the artery the blood now flows
the lapidary's eye in rapturous gaze
on tuneful bards whom laurel crowns apay
and many a little elfinscold
and pleas'd behold the scene of woe
with kisses four
where lust and turbulent ambition sleep
farewell thy prince still lives and still is free
the fairest garlands of th' aonian grove
and tyranny the shaft would guide
as walpole does the house of commons
to disappointment and fallacious hope
how bless'd the swain of bethnalgreen
she looks abroad and prunes herself for flight
with bells at feet and in nice measures dance
here still she dwells and here her votaries stroll
for me their gen'rous bosoms joy to prove
a strenuous enterprise to gain it man
yet still we live live in excess of pain
e'en in the zenith of his earthly bliss
convulse the mountain lab'ring for a vent
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
with more address a lover's note convey
for gideon's sword and mighty joshua's arm
while florio better knowledge drains
insensible how much they shine
of speech and offices may in my mind
none bars him out from his most secret thought
cautious i strike the panegyric string
yet suffer me to taste the balm that falls
and shivers every feather with surprise
who lives to fancy never can be rich
makes feeble efforts with his branchy horns
his closing wounds and drew fresh gore
in the crush'd wall a timecorroded cross
and like a flood rush o'er the land of love
i'd try if any pleasure could be found
for tho' she ne'er was seen before
while frolick fancy led the usual train
shade deepening over shade the country round
o thou full of beauty full of fame
and patience for my own
why trembling shrunk thy mother's frame
and o'er the feelings that will live
the scarlet feather not so gay appears
but those who dare approach this shrine
t' excuses in which reason has no part
'or any malice to the poultry
at such a sight superior beings pleas'd
trickling distils into the vernant glebe
how can man's curious spirit not inquire
some unregarded maiden hies
'blind to advice incorrigible vain
pale spectres thro' the streets of zoan roam
a stranger to the savage arts of life
god's image disinherited of day
fate having placed all truth above his reach
neptunian albion's hospitable beech
the sycamore capricious in attire
knows no superior by no laws confin'd
his feeling breast with purer flames shall glow
assumes not a superior part
dilates to a surprising cube or sphre
he'd call thee brother or he'd call thee out
hence to yon mountain which outbraves the sky
whose heart she wish'd at ease
and then if known some other way they'l drive
and all the craggy mountains yield
from infinite perfection to the brink
but cloe was not there
thistles now held more precious than the rose
in warbling melody she spends the night
too indolent to read too criminal to pray
to pour down wrath upon a thankless land
oh short and partial be their sway
our former dangers to recite
sad troubles gerard now pertain to thee
avaunt thou hellborn fiend no more
serene yet warm humane yet firm his mind
a frail false maid i lost but you
clim'b like a squirrel to his dray
on even keel with gentle gale
where'er our wand'ring footsteps stray
accomplishment if worthy so my soul
and mercy fled to as the last resort
but happy those who by a prudent care
nor be compassion to her fate deny'd
but these delights soon pall upon the taste
no noisy slaves attending round my room
the painful cares that vex the toilsome spring
than to betray his country and in act
and members barter'd honesty for gain
like flow'rs selected from the rest and bound
here the stage buskin there the lyric choir
by giddy power betray'd and flatter'd pride
italian squallers oft disgrace the stage
and ev'ry speech with zouns end
feel selfish pride distrust and anxious pain
haply some widow'd songster pours his plaint
a great oeconomist was she
and from their gilded roofs retire
the mosque of mahound or some queer pagod
as chaunts the woodman whilst the dryads weep
when nature's self was unconstrain'd and young
believe they dream and rub their waking eyes
the gods assent and juno vex'd no more
the social smile and sympathetic tear
my self transported to a rising ground
is prone to paint it dreadful who can take
she bids the gush of joy rise there
bathes with slow pace his academic grove
the steaming odours of the freshblown flowers
or did thy tragic muse sublimely tell
to shun the with'ring dame that made him gay
the base alone thy advocates shall be
should rudely brush the trembling drops away
and drew a tone from weakest words
he flew to hear my vocal reed
th'accomplish'd sacred song inscrib'd to you
can long my pensive mind employ
the human race some portion goes to all
from which they swerve not since that under force
a mine to satisfy the enormous cost
till life tho' late withdrew
this nurse of arts and freedom's fence
and the sad bondage of resistless love
how free contentment's humble shade
has the least rumour of our race arrived
once large of thought and rank'd among the wise
the falling tears bedew the crusty bread
but silent bats in drowsy clusters cling
content indeed to sojourn while he must
who studies ancient laws and rites
where cowper talbot somers yorke before
he that abstains and he alone does right
ah where's the joy of such precarious bliss
to a huge rock that clomb so high in air
this paradise of blooming joys
darkling i sigh and feed with dismal thoughts
my heart for thee has learn'd to prove
on the clear crystal's verdant bank he stood
wou'd fain say something in excuse
do none but turbid waters flow
soft term for indolence politely given
the gen'rous beast by pity sway'd
were never worthy to enjoy
eternal war with woe who bears it best
we'll innocently steal celestial fire
soothing but their cares to rest
there lurks the snake with speckled crest
and deems it the first moment of his fall
where mortals mix in undistinguish'd dust
and i by this will be a gainer too
for virtue honour'd and for parts esteem'd
would man but gather he might live for ever
snatch from the hedge a sprig of bay
to pleasure never was lorenzo deaf
if angels tremble 't is at such a sight
and all their labour'd monuments away
how blest my days my thoughts how free
and curs'd be he who minds his neighbour's trade
why not prevent them when they're such again
the smile ost practis'd deeply to deceive
no chance could sever nor the grave divide
and joy to celebrate thy praise
and keep your own to save his place
in fancy's eye and there the frowning bull
such was thy wisdom newton childlike sage
hail human liberty there is no god
but idly thou reject'st the charm
mean while at home his dame with silver hair
the fondest passions most ecstatick love
ah happy he who thus in magic themes
because perhaps you may
mark when from thousand mingled dyes
her pious hand the poor the mourner blest
florio had now forgot to wish
phoebus now shortning every shade
what stings of sorrow shall his bosom tear
nor may in tuneful song our passion tell
warm politicians term it partyrage
behold the lordly pedant in his school
by that assisted we can spy
to th' upright sentence or rhetorick plea
lay stretch'd along the verdant bed
teach me to aid the suppliant poor
to quench the inextinguishable fire
cloe has lost a heart sincere
yet as the doctor is my friend
wild shrubs and trees that form'd a gloomy wood
beheld the poet's aweful form arise
the richest prospect into present peace
the bloody signal waves the banners play
a longabiding race the deed shall pay
more treach'rous than the cat with prudish face
may i be there to see
fair fancy found and bore the smiling babe
nor you the kind indulgence will refuse
thro' the dark throng discern huge slaves of pride
like twisted hairs or lines of finespun thread
from knotty particles first floating wide
wing'd his unerring shaft and edg'd his victor sword
and antient arts he emulous revolves
als round about him many creatures stood
should they o'erleaping ev'ry fence of law
of dying well though doom'd but once to die
but love had like the cankerworm
germania trembled through a hundred states
of glit'rand lights that gild the glowing sky
whose sullen orb receiv'd a crimson dye
whom beauties strike false ornaments offend
that first united glows throughout their life
with luxury and death what tho' his wine
amaz'd the burgomaster sees
unhurt she stands applauds the archer's skill
who are yon active females like in face
on andes' icy steep exulting glows
own to be fruitful greece yet not so clean
such in some men their deadly lust to write
with her delighted o'er each scene i go
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
such wisdom flowing from a mouth but young
there with sad ghosts to pine and shadows dun
perhaps the fair whom for a theme you choose
each blessing springs for george is on the throne
blow the soft flute and strike the sounding lyre
but he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace
no gilded columns no gay temples rise
i flew i snatch'd her from the rigid north
to range on earth and bless mankind below
who was when she these legacies design'd
for as they frolick'd o'er the mead
ah paphian venus faithless as the seas
the nectarine his strong tint imbibes
yet ne'r one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds
her friend reply'd you shall not ask in vain
what right what true what fit we justly call
hurl'd all his terrors round
move as before nor life nor vigour lose
some dukes at marybon bowl time away
ask him indeed what trophies he has raised
still cheerful at the wellspread board be found
simplicius when he stares and seems to think
and little hearts for genuine glory beat
when thou my heart's dear boy in happy hour wast born
to blind with fears unfelt the moorish camp
so great's mans ambition that he would
what benefit alas would to thee grow
and let an impious miscreant's tear
in treason to my soul descend to bear
eurydice the floods
far as the sickening eye can sweep around
the greatest mortal cou'd not greater be
angel of woe that from the eternal hand
chins fall'n and not an eyeball to be seen
from majesty's full blaze insufferably bright
sent up in vapours to the baron's brain
the undulating string
and warm as you then tell me for you know
let charity forgive me a mistake
she tells the husband when his consort strays
but if o'erpois'd she sinks her downward course
his lights at equal distances to guide
but mark how much love's annals mend
and shuddering start to see it nigh
the wain that meets it passes swiftly by
and o'er the proud arcade their tribute pour
in motley dress a sparkling multitude
their joys entire for then they had not swerv'd
casts round religion's orb the mists of fear
but peace bold thought be still my bursting heart
where wickedness shall weep why paynim bards
a few examples of thy fading kind
starts from thine eye and thy extended arm
tho' here we can boast but of one to three
debarr'd his grape the muses still require
have rais'd my griefs to such a vast excess
not deigning a reply he bent his head
how sweetly you negotio procul
ev'n homer's numbers charm'd by parts alone
the hope of better things the chance to win
he praised a poacher precious child of fun
and now our ears with lamentations fills
here the firm guardians of the publick weal
led on by hope that neverdying ray
there watch each cloud that labours through the sky
the sun's ascent at noon unerring mark
never his poison'd rankling dart
susceptible of pity or a mind
and to soft musick lent her idle ear
let the dark hours no lively breaking see
to my aerial citadel ascends
convey the coarse in melancholy state
let on this head unfading flowers reside
of this bloodthirsty fiend in durance lay
bit flimsy things that have no strength to wear
well met he cries and happy sure for each
ye heavenattempting souls where virtues lie
doubtful we all exclaim'd what has been done
and looks undaunted for a birth again
rich fruits matur'd by glowing suns behold
yet more outragious is the season still
are others 'gain but killing cares to me
in dying sighs a long three hours are past
o'er all the host and clouds their drowsy heads
when silent time wi' lightly foot
spurn every gift the heavens dispense
nor like a puppy daggled thro' the town
their sense of feeling callous and obtuse
to stepwel and his kit i bid adieu
where wave thy groves dear native isle
nor by the gentlest bands of human life
at that still hour when awful midnight reigns
stately and strong the lofty castle stands
and bored with elbowpoints through both his sides
for much the treas'ry wanted a supply
and let me claim thy nuptial vow
' that sweet content with want can ever dwell
with saunt'ring step he climbs the distant stile
come then my bard thy heavenly fire impart
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
glorious preeminence forth from their dens
and like his milton scorn'd the rhiming chain
damon's happy eyes demand
now in the centre now in van or rear
on me they waste their rage in vain
down from olympus to his sisters flew
o'er my sick couch i saw thee bend
ere long the streams in a perverted course
or lust engenders and indulgence feeds
but let it go no farther pray
his fame which like the mighty caesar crown'd
since oft my stubborn will
he swore the world was welcome to his thoughts
now by degrees from hills to alps they rise
instead of learn'd he's call'd pedant
where these lone fields my rural home inclose
becloud their suns and sadden all their years
truth must support him or his glories fade
churchwarden stern or kingly overseer
then take me take me lock me in thy arms
severest judgment must allow them grace
or grant that hymen lights his torch
or wandring thoughtful in the silent wood
and to some youth gigantic yield your charms
and to new worlds disclose her lustrous day
o best of wives o dearer far to me
but when the bitter blast with keener force
the playful sun looks artfully between
since wak'd to mimic life again in stone
a royal chief he pants for fame
deserve the pref'rence garrick take the chair
though every cupid he should smother
by reason hated and by fancy feared
by sure prognostics when to dread a show'r
as if he meant fierce battle toa darrain
thou at stupendous truth believ'd
but love each day renews th' torturing scene of death
feels the glad truth and is it hid from you
in gen'rous love of others' good to find
streams never flow in vain where streams abound
a young madonna bending o'er her child
and scann'd the line where truth seem'd writ no more
for transport dost thou call on every hour
true to his king and to the public just
the grand transition that there lives and works
no fair inscription teaches whom to mourn
who live and love within the sacred bower
and her moist palm with eager fingers press
oblivion be thy blackest plume display'd
the heavy cumberous miserable day
and voices more than human thro' the void
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
quits the lone cloyster and the horrid grate
still murm'ring runs or seems to murmur still
hence to your ancient seat
toll forth with frequent pause its sullen knell
my lord in usual taste began to yawn
there each immortal name 'tis thine to give
then sleep was undisturb'd by fear unscared
the gen'rous critick fann'd the poet's fire
who give sweet looks and early rhimes
pomona's aid in vain the miry fields
the palecheek'd virgin of the night
hence what loud outcries and wellmeaning rage
look'd down and smil'd and authoriz'd my flame
great from the lustre of his crown
with every nerve pursue but you ye flocks
less fam'd for singing than for love
o ho here's one i see from parson sly
prize it ye ministers ye monarchs spare
and only bear the load of life
there was within each secret crime
content with you to yield my vital breath
who knows how far a rattle may outweigh
i who have spent my nights and nightly days
while its fierce teeth his tender body gnaws
if aught i know he show'd the arduous way
where swam two finny creatures one of gold
i come in vain the tender accent falls
that inly gnaws the secret heart
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
when he to jordan's rapid torrent came
to the dear tender partner of his heart
and mere idea nature's mighty frame
a rolling mass of ice upon the ground
and in the varied scenes that round them shine
th' obedient ductile passions ebb and flow
and unrelenting avarice drives her slaves
of every thought and wish of every hour
and help me to my journey's end
in boundless prospect yonder shagg'd with wood
lost to the world and strangers to the sun
there muse on empire's fallen state
simplicity meek rural queen
and truck preferments at the public fair
the horrors of a legal rape
or of its beauty or perfume
on weak foundations raise th' enormous weight
such now is man deprav'd that fear must sway
unaw'd by numbers follow nature's plan
the cheek to cinder rival to the brute
from the moist meadow to the brownbrow'd hill
his chilling breath sweeps o'er the wat'ry plains
nor thus advances others bliss alone
all means i us'd that might allay his pain
'my rushy couch and frugal fare
fruition haughty nymph she never deigns
th' inclement season and the toilsome war
in the red eveningsky thus pass'd the time
not hideous visions as of late but draughts
on nature write with every beam his praise
when his lone footsteps on the sage obtrude
his gracious smiles their rising doubts prevent
and oft by cynthia's silver light
just tho' unsearchable the ways of heaven
return and mingle with the dust
thou liv'st o stanhope providence's care
have laid aside the general's staff
and own'd the thrilling power of verse
a wonder in omnipotence itself
hastes to the pile nor heeds her weeping friends
a face hung out thro' which is seen
here to return and die at home at last
and drove far off beneath a deeparch'd cave
and spring eternal decks the fragrant shade
caught at a court purged off by purer air
see the vile king his iron sceptre bear
has dropt her anchor and her canvas furl'd
stept forth her sandals tipp'd with snow
no goddess you but woman are
faints into airs and languishes with pride
good parts are better than eight parts of speech
to silent groves where weeping yew
just starting from the corn she cheerly sings
for israel's god is girt with burning rage
eat up with carking care and penurie
the world his subject was but he was thine
if e'er my spirits want a flow
to suit the tenor of her gurgling sighs
nor ought retards unless invited out
and quite consume the frame
from highpark corner down to bednalgreen
and swelling with disdain
immur'd they lie close in the pearly shell
high athos oete and the pin'y top
and mine the fair designs that raphael's soul
all fair and spotless like a virgin bride
warm'd with thy hopes and wing'd with all thy zeal
the various graces of the female lay
cold weeping winter i come all to thee
in israel's dream come from and go to heaven
to this sad place your earliest garlands bring
they used on all occasions richard's hands
the circling blood with conscious ardour flies
and cast o'er every fault oblivion's veil
while nature imag'd strange distress
and their high deeds submitting to the stroke
yet not unconscious what a doubtful task
you'd laugh to see the honest wives
that castingweight pride adds to emptiness
the court he said knew all the rest
in mournful accents and melodious strains
to pay to pow'rs supreme a reverence due
thro' all th' unbounded tracts of happiness above
were then your progeny but owls
life's precious hours in thinking to no end
in bands commix'd the foll'wing troops succeed
for tho' new riders shou'd abound
and learn the wonders of olympian dew
and like an angry torrent forc't his way
did thus his sentiments unfold
sees far as human optics may command
and icy horror froze his ebbing blood
which doom'd me to a presbyterian's power
no fluttering in my breast
each follow'd his own fancy to delight
the spiendid scene once overcast
a single sentence proof against the world
ere his exhausted spirits can return
a sigh would heave her breast
belinda burns with more than mortal ire
not that his hours devoted all to care
giant dwarf genius elf hermaphrodite
for guiltless woes her sorrows flow
unspotted fair with downcast look
lord of my life my future cares are thine
not such th' alert and active measure life
that ply tough oars from morn to night
or among fairy meadows steal
your courage is not greater than my love
nor feast the body while the mind must fast
and blazing straw before his orchard burns
what is the charm that each successive year
these mould'ring walls with ivy crown'd
whose noble precept charm'd his wond'ring ear
how blessings brighten as they take their flight
so taper strait and fair
to pity's ear shall tell thy tale
thee partial heaven has bless'd profusely kind
and shine by situation hardly less
there too my little fold which late i left
who always prays and never faints
my very gentle reader yet unborn
while your deep woe my humble lays rehearse
belov'd of paeon listen to my strain
and in each pulse a percy's ardor glows
in thee oh monarch i a father find
before the turk's dread fury when he came
full in my view thy nobler soul appears
or should we sing the subject of the day
where'r you go i still attend
foes to reflection enemies to truth
yet still the winds that cool my brow
in smiles she sunk her grief to lessen mine
behold him deckt in spruce and trim array
these equal syllables alone require
caelia the loveliest maid on earth
and dances round and round with gilding rays
vain was the warrior's haughty boast
asswage the racking pains that seize
the spacious desert bright'ning in the sun
in foreign climes condemn'd to roam
and whips and tyburn testify their crimes
your brother death your place supplies
the gulphy lee his sedgy tresses rears
to aim at words inspire the poet's lay
as tubalcain the ductile metal wrought
by length of pike not length of ell
shall we trace science from her eastern home
then let me range the shadowy lawns
this still shall flourish in immortal bloom
of modest poets thou be first
for ev'ry gasp of air he draws returns in sighs
by less attempts we safely might have gain'd
bows his meek head and god eternal dies
and make thee twice a beggar at thy death
oft faunus leaves arcadia's plain
the days his daughters as they spin our hours
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
mistaken fair one check thy fancy's flight
first cousin to the mustardpot
i trembled at the dismal sounds
ye french editions of a british fool
those falling tears those mournful sounds
wrath pride ambition and impure desire
then must i still my sire obey
enchanting spirit dear variety
once in an age to perfect some rare beauty
haste now philosopher and set him free
the mighty transports of a gen'rous love
he likes yours little and his own still less
short views we take nor see the lengths behind
but learn of slender to deplore
and oft have sally'd out to pillage
pours forth unwitty jokes and swears
this caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow
one fam'd for goodness and one fam'd for joke
but now the sounds of population fail
tall was her stature unconfin'd her air
and too obliging to be easy
but fancy downward urge thy flight
prophetic future times unfold
this foll'wing douts those flames with peevish discontent
for 'tis the price of dearest joy
dear doctor of st mary's
heaven's daughter helldebauch'd her hand alone
and smok'd his pipe and strok'd his horse
a vet'ran warrior in the christian field
conceals destruction while with eager hope
associate with the shrubs of earth
glorious the catholic amen
yet here th' eternal sates thy last retreat
dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease
who from thy sparkling coast benignant hoyle
as with your shadow i with these did play
dam up the way and make the channel less
what prussia's monarch or the russ
at our fair t'other day she appear'd sir
their fleeting nature would endure
shall at our bidding quit his lawful prey
they gnash their foamy teeth and frown severe
far from your england's happier home
shall gratify their hov'ring souls
triumphant umbriel on a sconce's height
is such a life so tediously the same
waded thro' seas of blood how will they curse
nor factious rage mistake for publick zeal
dazzled o'erpower'd with the delicious draught
too weak a tye unequal thoughts to bind
in vain each gilded turret rears its head
now rouz'd i start and wing'd with fear i run
with conscience and with thee lust in their hearts
the just the generous debt is paid
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
that take from death the terrors or the sting
attentive hear each groan each sigh
the lowring heav'n looks then with sadder hue
this wholly evil that supremely good
invincible and oaks and pines and cedars
and for myself not feeling feel for thee
will none the wretched crawling thing regard
e'en virgil to maecenas paid his court
for now among the yellow broom
in all its power is known
in earth in heav'n no subject can be found
the bittern knows the time with bill ingulpht
i know to make fair columbel your bride
detects false beauty real grace calls forth
a third lies poison'd who false celia lov'd
he gives the word and mutiny soon roars
was blasphemy his sin or did he stray
through pleasing paths of moral and divine
pour'd hymns to freedom and the rising morn
but when unpack'd your disappointment groans
for when they praise your blinking ee
to crown some proud infringer of the laws
her want of care screening and keeping warm
wide from the throne the blest contagion spreads
to virtue sav'd is like th' immortals blest
but stern was george let them who had thee strong
to bribes or pray'rs few women would cry nay
another toffs must rabbits breed
for they with doubts do all their crimes pursue
with native plants enamel'd o'er
each circling hour beguil'd
as fragrant too as ointments poured forth
nurse of a people in misfortune's school
the keenest feelings of the human mind
describes how blazing comets roam
array'd in youth's full bloom and nature's prime
with shrieks and frantic uproar may the gods
and parents here beside their children sleep
how learning in warm seminaries spread
hence death's black scroll dire tortures hence are giv'n
hangs nodding from the lowbrow'd rock
t'oblige my country or to serve my king
with phillips shall the peaceful vallies ring
never let me such cruel faith approve
that ditty must my waking charmer greet
that build the towering pyramid the proud
and ages e'er the mantuan swan was heard
dances in ether like the lightest leaf
the flowery vales the falling floods
long held and scarcely disengaged at last
beneath the smoaking sirloin stretch'd immense
make but my name thy love and love that still
subsist and center in one point a friend
and all that's good still light upon ye
but modest manners innocent of art
should be a despot absolute and boast
be warn'd ye fair that listen round
god made the country and man made the town
more sanguinecolours then the wings of day
of that calamitous mischief has been found
dazling as sols unsufferable light
for rules of poetry an't rules of courts
pois'ning the waters where their swarms abound
of active mind and vigorous lustyhed
repose and friends to tyrant fashion mark
and make the passing minutes sweetly smile
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
i'll bless the good and to the ill
from noisy mirth and business free
and hymeneal songs are wafted all around
bent knees round shoulders and dejected looks
and leave the racers of the world their own
its humble turfform'd cot its devious glades
upon the southern side of the slant hills
to melt him down like wax and then impress
and frequent at the middle waste of night
elegant as simplicity and warm
nor wishes to be free from care
can mere machines be with such pow'rs endued
let me not ever prove should wish'd success
felt each soft transport of parental joy
again new fred'rics thunder on the main
thou cool betrayer temperate in ill
thus rose the captive's sighs
and is it fit in hacqueton and mail
if any spark of wit's delusive ray
and famine by her children always known
fearless of death and yet afraid of shame
sweet village maids from neighbouring hamlets stroll
reason is upright stature in the soul
for shades shall be where now the thistle red
shines not for me no bed of nature yields
thence eye my lawns with verdure bright
her infant sire with food supplies
to see their sov'reign and confess his sway
and up he got in haste to ride
dishevel'd lo her beauteous tresses fly
at solemn pauses thro' the swelling base
a refuge to the neighbouring poor
the bat ambiguous and illomen'd owl
up the tall elm the woodbine swarms
nor sorrow's dread solemnity prophane
and darts through nature at a single glance
till the soft sound dissolve the knot of fate
but to the mountain courted by the sand
and only in her children blest
he with us sacred nymphs profusely mourns
yet spleen oppressive marrs her chear
in all attempts but for their country bold
thrice happy they who view with stable eyes
to tempt the leader of the christian band
is to discharge the duties of his sphere
in future times whatever masters came
some folks will win they cannot chuse
lewd songs loud laughter and all that
some reigning dress but you the choice revoke
since hope but sooths to double my distress
and wooes him to be wise nor wooes in vain
her right a regal sceptre seem'd to hold
their colours burnish and by hope inspir'd
the funeral dirge they down the torrent rowl'd
and wanton vagrants as make london vast
for he from god's own mouth had the command
how far above our knowledge and our praise
present the happy scenes of peace
by cold contempt or favour's fostering sun
more than the sun invok'd that gilds the grassy lane
wou'd you my friend not mix the purer flame
and by the wellknown joy to distant plains
then i repented i had vow'd no more
and trusting in his god surmounts them all
impeachment stops the speaker's pow'rful breath
which frights the shrinking soul lo back she starts
no more in iron bonds the wretched groan
and damn his own good name to rescue thine
shine without warmth another song prepare
and catch their dewy nectar from the skies
with humble hope her eye to her is given
then press no more there's not another swain
and raz'd from glory's page their ancient name
for oh i grudge the nymphs shou'd come so near
and if too light but turns thee gayly mad
on which invention shall be long employ'd
shakes off her huge oppressive weight of woes
where trees distil their kindly dews
a tastless river or a shallow stream
and derwent sister streams and avong fair
'twere well his holiness were half as sure
others will not lucina's call obey
because for me no more the sparkling moments fly
't is not ambition charms thee 't is a cheat
tonguedoughty pedant was athenia's soul
or if i blame 'tis only that they dare
loud trumpets did his wrath declare
the door just opening with a latch
noble and young who strikes the heart
to check thy daring fire
a future bard these awful domes may see
i say my pray'rs and lead a sober life
'among the rest young edwin bow'd
a soldier friend would save and not destroy
the sword of dacia nor the parthian dart
mighty victor mighty lord
one civil rage alarm'd the trembling woods
coherent sighs and waft them far away
to mutual terror and compassion's tears
to make her hold the least dispute
as if with adamantine barr'd
wilt thou once more a kind attention lend
who malice and detraction scorn
poor is the friendless master of a world
and in the volume of thy book
torn on the racking cross these wounds for you
should fate command me to the farthest verge
but chiefly thee whose influence breathed from high
they'll grow no more but all their growth is sound
may all the gods forget their care of me
what more than gothic ire
sleep that the sting of sorrow charms
viudictive fix for murder is his trade
and bless from fools this holy ground
and force the captive from his native cell
the tragic muse discloses under shapes
amidst the tumult of a maddening world
what friend upbraids me with a broken trust
you'll find most punctual and observant
by future poets shall be sung
thy semblance let it bear
cries well done saint and claps him on the back
the hart and lion at a distance keep
in all the pride of fullblown charms
and form genteel were all in vain
enjoys triumphant every grace
then glories yet unseen shall o'er them rise
no fiend's so cruel as a reas'ning brute
o muchlov'd maid whilst life remains
which fancy's busy power employs
nor blot the day with an ungrateful tear
while the poor grasshopper must chirp below
delights to fix or glides reluctant by
while vile apostates tremble in a calm
on the smooth floods the swelling billows rise
that his example had a magnet's force
regenerate and pure pour all thyself
nor freezing sky nor sultry checking me
to sleep unheard of than to glow
my ravish'd soul to extacy untaught
drink deep the deeper then the more divine
justice and truth direct their pen
th' astonish'd swains with rev'rend awe beheld
or others' good for such are crimes alone
and o'er their cups to have a fling
while rocks and floods reflect the quivering gleam
in softer words they find a surer fate
he ask'd in vain the dovedrawn car
the greater we esteem his art
and his stol'n honour all his shame displays
to breathe in distant fields a purer air
effects and causes were not understood
much fame he won which time shall ne'er destroy
propitious pow'rs afford that rest
by phoebus newly tann'd and dry'd
explored the deeps and shallows of the pen
and rose to labour with the morning light
not one of these shall fail none want her mate
from toil and cares bids age and want remove
and judge oh judge my bosom by your own
catch flying bliss ne be by ought foresaid
and wak'd her slumb'ring atoms into birth
a rougher theme demands my pensive verse
the song of sion is a tasteless thing
while vales and woods and echoing hills rebound
the flame of passion thro' the struggling soul
for ever hides and glows in the supreme
and teach that snowy breast to heave no more
and low immers'd in woes
the spanish product this to gauls has seem'd
so heroes taught by doubtful shrines
oh think of transports which ye whilom tasted
from motives such as his though not the best
relents a while to the reflected ray
i'd choose some kinder youth and fix 'em there
who seeks secure to rule be first her care
such is that sprinkling which some careless quean
and spight of reason spight of art
dispell'd the dewy mists and gave the day
can sink but hope will to their wretchedness
then fly and leave a weight of woes behind
whether he greet the blushing morn
and thou shalt travel too full many a weary mile
the proud deformity of scars admir'd
if the gull'd conqueror receives the chain
and yet of sycophants would buy a name
just fate os wanton pride and vain excess
where is the spice kiss of the southern gale
imparadis'd blest denizons ye dwell
and saith you often magic arts do try
nor is it hard to beautifie each month
my head grows warm all reason i despise
and proudly boast an equal skill
some sturdy patriots sworn to pull them down
with viperous rage the breast from whence it sprung
eternalt ages free from care and pain
from the dwarf daisy which like infants clings
invited from the rock to whose dark cliff
all do not love in clotting fields to sweat
and now from every task withdrawn
and hide thy head thy shame thou canst not hide
plead thou the fatherless and widow's cause
beauty can little execution do
and who has greater sense but greater sorrow shares
and you ye poor who still lament your fate
essential pleasure passion's fierce illapse
thus patrige by his wit and parts
like leaf or blossom fades away
dares walk on foot while slaves in coaches ride
of that dear shed which first ye knew
safe let me hide me from the eye of day
there's not a day but to the man of thought
but what avails it to the world beside
thee shall these eyes behold to health restor'd
and 'mongst my brightest treasures they shall shine
no more your highdescended fame we view
and waste in cloyster'd walls thy pensive hours
bigger and bigger the proud dunghill grew
to the same notes of love and soft desire
or for one lover left the town
the nymph he loves is sure no longer coy
here let our eve of life be spent
fool had that bough a pumpkin bore
too much for heaven to make one emmet more
to cut as well as shine
a melancholy fool without her bells
as such is love by realms ador'd
her midnight meals in secresy she takes
than the fair shepherdess of old romance
tho' strange may seem the dismal tale
shall we ascribe the origin of man
ere this had fill'd the sounding trump of fame
through lanes unknown o'er stiles they ventured
but hunger quick'ning up his wit
are barr'd from devious paths by being blind
and left some sickly changeling in their stead
in patient watchings for the common foe
where dwells the multitude we gaze around
and weep a second in th' unfinish'd song
the form of beauty smiling at his heart
comes winter unprovided and a train
the twelve good rules the royal game of goose
of hourly peril though the clefted domes
the plump convivial parson often bears
meantime with sudden interruption loud
such are their natures and their passions such
too late to chear the dregs of lengthen'd life
bright from their cups the rattling treasure falls
till kings call forth th' idea's of thy mind
but let true reason once resume her reign
and wisdom short of infinite may swerve
the daisy spreads again her bloom
yet oft a tender wish recalls my mind
sunk in their urns behold the pride of pomp
bade from its central base capacious laid
resounding once with plato's voice arise
blooms beauteous in the gloomychequer'd crowd
who with mortals deign'st to dwell
and sultanates o'er all her charms
unknown and when detected still was seen
something eternal had there e'er been nought
and many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground
and sprightly juices warm in cold decay
and black before him nought but deathbed groans
has shed his leafy honours and around
this to disclose is all thy guardian can
uncertain objects still our hopes employ
exalted on his pedestal of pride
which nature made t' explain the soul
how does thy manner to thy words impart
but not to manage leisure with a grace
but artful chang'd the subject and the lore
now strongly rouze while heaven his zeal inspires
i fly to them and ask 'em o'er and o'er
the tardy steps of reason and at once
what mighty genious thus excites my breast
true woman to the last my peroration
the compact sign'd with beauty now
but down he sank upon his dying bed
to albert streight he flies
'tis nature only bears perpetual sway
fill high the sparkling bowl
the world's sworn advocate without a fee
but ere lov'd thames thy flow'ry banks i leave
come my mates let us work
still place their native country first
for praise or censure to the common eye
no proud vicegerent of astrea reign'd
would wave her hand and pointing say
here rests secure from ev'ry human woe
thy sons corrupted carasses are laid
from all malengine safe and evil stour
yet the fine arts were what he finish'd least
can i forget the days of anxious pain
thus unsuspected he had watch'd the roads
the rightful patron of th'eventful tale
transform'd to combs the speckled and the white
and hours roll round that brought him liberty
reproach their owner with that love of rest
while arms of oak enfolding all
on britain's fond credulity they prey
in awful expectation of our end
i only would repress them to secure
a pensive exile on the plain
the softest moss be sure to lay
where pure religion seldom ventures nigh
to mercy consecrate the hour
the spur is pow'rful and i grant its force
for each expression ev'ry teeming thought
my wandering eye survey'd
to catch the soul when drawn into the eye
none knew like him the heav'nly notes to swell
scorn of the proud or of the base to beg
undaunted truth and dignity of mind
her he slew her chastity she prov'd
my daily thought my nightly dream
for others woes but smiles upon her own
reflect fond girl at morning's dawn
but inclination proves the stronger law
with deepmouth'd notes rouse up the trembling deer
not from perfidious gaul or haughty spain
she wakes alas to business and to woes
now in the senate rais'd her pompous tone
that shook the circling seas and solid earth
for all the splendor that a court can give
but who is he whom now she views
and chanc'd th' opprobrious strain to hear
the lesser hell in passage to the great
eer yet ingenuous youth thy steps retire
thus in the morn a courser have i seen
that ev'ry station has its proper ill
urging her destin'd labours to persue
contriving wisdom in the whole we own
a poem on the fairest fair
and with him bright maria join'd
when from its shades a soldier sprung
nor stretch an arm to hurl him from the throne
oh may the kindest influence above
to tear him limb from limb the mouser thus
firm cement of the world endearing tie
she hardly gave them leisure to complain
as adam by an injur'd maker driven
stole first into the mind yet not by all
and pity me your friend
the wretched villain pinion'd up on high
time used the man who consecrates his hours
by holy druids' couragebreathing songs
on every beam we see to walk with men
are there who trusting to our love of ease
and writhing dreadful on the iron bed
till the brooks fill and all the heats asswage
low sculks the hind beneath the rage of pow'r
and with strong confidence lay hold on thee
that will he nill he to the greathouse
a favour never to forget or hide
or with his blessings count his want of health
taste can no ray of bliss impart
for as that charnel's earth you see
he soars beyond the hackney critic's reach
afraid to leap into the opening gulph
selflove and social are the same
no words can shew the beauties of his face
no giantrace no tumult of the skies
which neither earth nor air nor water can endure
behold the meadow's painted pride
his griefs wound home and leave a sting behind
her potent wand the circle broke
nor on the plain the stately palm was seen
while gratitude and love made service sweet
from thomond of milesian race
at length the glimm'ring objects fade
but hope the med'cine may be found
but guests that sought it in th' appointed one
and whisper to my sliding heart beware
for all that else we gain's not worth a moment's strife
the meek and bashful boy will soon be taught
ah how my dear shall i deserve thy charms
curs'd be the precepts of my selfish sire
wou'd all these thoughts incessantly suggest
extends his wing promulgates his commands
while round her arm unseen a serpent twines
fly hearty to deceive the tedious time
hearteasing ale whose sorrowsoothing sweets
sir will you please to walk before
dawning a dimmer day on human sight
for now she shun'd the face she sought before
willisian burlton muchlov'd geers his marsh
the grand morality is love of thee
o that the stars as some have feign'd let fall
he scarce admits to see his face
go learn of vagrants fit companions go
of mithridates whose aspiring mind
after the thunder of the wars
on the parch'd lip one precious drop may pour
and with exstatick gratitude his laws obey'd
for works may have more wit than does 'em good
as where apelles in accordance meet
a sudden transport tho' not lasting fire
come then my love nor trust the future day
while round the saphire throne th' ethereal train
when reapers pine with toil and sultry heat
but some reject this sustenance divine
the reas'oning pow'r vouchsafed of course inferred
but now alas your charms are fled
and bellowing irontubes their sulphur fir'd
to sooth the pangs of toilsome life 'tis given
and in these shades the false impostor met
make no excursions in philosophy
of nature calls him to his high reward
each varied motion beams th' expressive eye
who well might purchase had we their good sense
who spread his wavy sweep
leans on his spear to take his farewel view
attuned to the birds and woodland melody
when stars and sun are dust beneath his throne
each quaint stale scrap which every subject hits
such as our motive is our aim must be
while joins and mixes to thy hand
still let me o'er the watery waste
would it surprise thee be thou then surprised
stern winter brings his gloomy train
wisdom you boast to you is given
thy soul how passionately fond of fame
well you sincerity display
he sung the winds are charm'd to sleep
to wake a mighty nation's ancient fires
yet still absorbed in studious care
bards sages heroes patriots princes stand
again with bold triumphant hand
where by the potent sun elated high
like is th' event of the unkind embrace
without a sigh resign my aged breath
ten thousand lovers swell'd her train
yea marry shalt thou and with all my heart
would hear my thoughts but fear to speak their own
the sire as courteous as the daughter kind
your sex like ours has had its phaton
in dimples deep love's eddies which drawin
from macedonia's madman to the swede
for fraud or force must work the wish'dfor change
what though abundance round his dwelling spreads
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
has she no spark that may be deem'd her own
or raving winds o'er barren mountains fly
now shown by cynthia's silver ray
the crowd adore him as he passes by
wafts all the pomp of life into your ports
in blackest days some glimmerings of light
whilst the soft breeze of pleasure's tempting air
thus on myself in toils i spend my rage
the wreath he won drew down an instant curse
and lifted in one service fight
and fling the brandish'd fabre from his hand
she stopt in fixt attention viewing
whose gay inhabitants thou shalt behold
thus cruel fate inconstant as the air
both vow'd and sought revenge
again jove seeks his father's realms to taste
finer than aught the indian chieftain knows
cropt the broad daisies as they sprung
if phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye
but jove who in high heaven does mortals prive
yet tremble do and wildly stare
on virtue's basis only fame can rise
i mount the lofty keep with force till now unknown
why idly fleet thy unapplauded days
the god of sleep freed from the noisy dread
view the light naiads trip in wanton ranks
catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame
he stoop'd to truth and moraliz'd his song
the batchelor's attended
the love of cards let sloth infuse
soft vigils rather let me keep
death made familiar loses half his power
with answering care opprest
there let her sit with her infernal chyme
was it for this the raging seas i crost
muttering the winds at eve with hoarser voice
while all the sea was still and winds were heard no more
cease thy complaints methinks ev'n now
heroes who knew to wield the righteous spear
breathes purer air on vincent's rugged height
by ev'y potentate he dealt with fool'd
a snug pretence to drive a trade
and hie 'em to the seas there's mischief to be done
o'erlook'd and unemploy'd fell sick and died
how long shall false fantastic honour draw
fit for an english poet to pursue
guides the triumphant carr of night
supporting on his knee the drooping head
with grief she gazes on the antique wall
not for myself i pray but for my father
whate'er the theme that others never feel
but yield to my unhappy fate
his name the muse chaste virtue's friend
steam'd eager from the red horizon round
mean time disclosing ages as she spoke
unheard we sing when partyrage runs strong
where impious war and discord nurse of blood
when youngey'd spring profusely throws
beneath thy window each new day
the hoary sire heaven's guardian care demands
how passing wonder he who made him such
the dusky woods conceal him from their sight
and she from out the veiling cloud
tavern and coffeehouse unwilling
a creeping mist o'erspreads the silent field
and when the good deceiv'd sir francis
then bounce 'tis all that bounce can crave
thy humblest reed could more prevail
yet could the gentle fair but see me mourn
for stars have fought their battles leagued with man
comfort no more her healing balm will shed
so he must have a wife an't please ye
hark the solemn nightingale
o'erleaps and claims the future and unseen
when holy freedom died
sleep on poor child whilst i withdraw
now welcome all ye peaceful shades and springs
none now ignobly will your warmth restrain
when all that's human quits the place
till the storm gathers and the sun retires
committed once into the public arms
each lively thought the hallow'd muse inspires
and now to memphis quick advances make
forbid the victims unreveng'd to die
think you my song too turbulent too warm
he pours the song to harmony and love
but sov'reign heav'n whose ways are ever wise
but we brave britains foreign laws despis'd
what sorrow was thou bad'st her know
thy very children watch for thy disgrace
light o'er the deep with flutt'ring cupids crown'd
witholds her gifts from these once favour'd plains
while nancy earns the praise to shakespeare due
we now and then see something like them here
tho' lawless licence arm'd her harpy claws
why would you tempt the fickle seas again
with annual hospitality what time
and silent night has seen the torrent roll
so lovely so exceeding sweet and fair
serving at once my mistress and my friend
to wear the verdant mantle of the spring
and at her feet the lowly tribute fling
on nature's bounteous honey fed
pleas'd on his various freaks to dwell
to fix the future ardent heart's desire
to breathe a second spring
hear lord for power supreme is thine
pardon for foes and love for human kind
the nibbling flocks around me bleat
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
porsenna like a statue fix'd appear'd
that soothe the warm poetic dream
the gen'ral pity not the boast of rome
a stedfast sorrow in her face appears
that chas'd the slaves and we their flying game
and swells and deepens to the cherish'd eye
the slave of sunshine and of gloom
four hours in a tiny cell
they deep incision make and talk the while
the lower part is cramp'd into a hook
form'd the fair prospect of thy promis'd reign
if e'er in evil hour betray'd
which is much worse for when that one doth speak
my age's hope my youth's best boast
who stops the tempest on its way
from the sun's heat where all the passing hours
'we chickens are your betters due
to be admir'd you only need be seen
whate'er my stars include
thro' all my senses run
sigma presents the social droves
where footmen in the seat of critics sit
may sigh to think how oft he found
of tasteless splendor and magnificence
sound thro' the world 'tis done the measure's full
o what a root o what a branch is here
pour streams of liquid fire while from above
o may the gods extend his vital date
and the obedient servant at the gate
sweeter than warbled sounds that win the sense
to comic merit breaks down nature's fence
yet to consult a little seem'd no crime
and leave us leisure to be good
the feeling heart simplicity of life
the same fond husband father brother friend
on a firm rock by friends admir'd and prais'd
sigh'd till i turn'd our ther into storms
nor let a feebler pulse control
great neptune whose commands controll the seas
it ill becomes thee thus to treat
if all were minded so the times should cease
forbidden ah yet nature will be found
if guards mechanically form'd in ranks
deep feels the fiend within his tortur'd breast
in foreign parts one tells his tale
considers all injustice with a frown
thus it is deem'd in english nobles wise
when desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan
but let the bugbear timerous infants fright
lo heav'n spreads all its stars let those explain
thus far with good success i think i've scribbled
the thunder raises his tremendous voice
one order allinvolving and intire
lakes forests cities plains extended wide
to thee my fair the chearful linnet sings
see the third witness laughs at bliss remote
and we forget to live from hand to mouth
first give the mortal wound then seize the prey
at this entranc'd he lifts his hands and eyes
gives ours a greater elevation
but still these sights so oft are seen
but flavia's rhetoric best perswades
who prostitute their votes for price
no more the vocal groves rejoice
such as in silence of the night
a court before without much state
distain'd with blood the pavement and the wall
the sun retires behind a cloud
and call the stars to listen every star
ah draw the veil shrill trembles thro' the air
e'er felt such rage resentment and despair
e'er long some bowing smirking smart abb
all find all feel it too in some degree
thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon
like that where once ulysses held the winds
yon' shepherd idly stretch'd on the rude rock
what charms attractive grace thy modest mien
but faith she spoke extremely well
in vain my fluttering soul would wing its way
that innocence itself must suffer wrong
the clouds return and thick the moistned air
by supplemental shifts the best he may
already now the snowdrop dares appear
all that is human in me to protect
whose motley stations wear a doubtful face
o stop them ere they stem italia's wave
then thou wouldst come and with a smile
there was he pinch'd and pitied thump'd and fed
have burnt to dust a nobler pile
when stella strikes the tuneful string
now let some news salute your ear
then catch some sound to bear delighted home
vile intercourse what tho' the glittering robe
no leaf expands nor dye displays
no pitying heart no eye afford
secure with you the secret shall remain
time flies in haste be you in haste to live
whose gentle bosom no resentment fires
who shrink an arm or prop an able knee
as this to thoughts indulgent to the eyes
what if ten thousand butes and foxes bawl
nor in the pink and mottled vault
of hollow gewgaws only dress and face
in youth's gay season fix'd my roving eye
from all her fair loquacious kind
then vents his specious fraud in words like these
as his wise plan demanded and when past
when from long fasts fierce appetites arise
ungenial blasts attending curl the streams
all that our rev'rence joy or hope create
though partial power its ministers may awe
her features in the mirror for of all
and think with grateful pity on my pain
inferiour orders have a meaner home
when first the infant passions rise
nor to the aidimploring voice thine ear
that followd it as gentle day
and when the little hand unapt she found
and spurns at titles scepters thrones and kings
for why sublimity of style
faithful asserters in him centring meet
insulting the poor curate's callous wife
from her lov'd cottage and her silent shade
be fleeting as the empty wind
beneath their care behold the work refine
th' instructive page and heedfully explore
the dame who proud of virtue's praise
his easy knowledge seem'd intuitive
sad monument of ruthless deeds
why thank her then not weepe nor mone
forgot the patt'ring hail the driving snow
his tender bloom to cherish nor witheld
at length unable to contend
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
but rude at first and not with easy slope
roxena matchless maid nor rear'd in vain
their reason and their passion still at strife
her laurels torn her spear revers'd
but sweeter to the breast the social charms
come gentle mirth and gaiety
thus far all nature calls on thy belief
compar'd with thee be all lifewriters dumb
to ceaseless service by a ceaseless force
omnipotent for i see nought but power
kind dews refresh the plain
that varying life attend
and by the learn'd so many ages own'd
and clearly shows the vestal life is right
the tears ran hopping down his cheek
the echoing vales resound
to day they've good to morrow no success
this conduit from thy rural hours we hope
whilst we instead of eastern gales
yet how describe the various god
scarce known and only mention'd with disgrace
of ancient writ unlocks the learned store
each olive meed of old renown
where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray
guilt chills my zeal and age benumbs my powers
the pensive pleasures calm delight
and linnet twitter from the blossom'd thorn
like an insidious serpent softly creep
and what timotheus was is dryden now
while through the mother's heart quick rapture thrills
whilst life's important business is undone
like other slaves from setters free
gaz'd on the vision with distracted eye
and heav'n alone his ruin can prevent
with theirs one human eye survey'd
should alienate the fields that wear his name
unarm'd almanzor is a king lead on
the sun's defiance and the flock's defence
hid in the narrow turn of winding streets
coolly malicious by design a knave
or jealousy with rank'ling tooth
where are the crowns that round my head
you know full well but may you never know
with mimic grandeur and illusive light
with joy i'll own how great how good his mind
crassus but sleeps ardelio is undone
a life to saving but that saves to live
who durst assert the juster ancient cause
to gallic loire and jordan's humbled shore
when winter's stormy season is begun
though press'd with hunger oft or comelier cloaths
believe me sir your cost and cares
shall be the hand that has unbound thy chains
he feared for himself and warn'd the knight
my ear i thought too narrow for the art
boastless as now descends the silent dew
and daily more enamour'd of the cheat
a mind unmov'd by ev'ry vulgar fear
as conscious all their love is in arrear
fair queen of arts from heaven itself who came
stars countless each in his appointed place
refuge of atheists whose supine desire
embosom'd in the bloombespangled thorn
distraction ravag'd on the publick weal
certain as fate and sudden as the wind
of all the vengeful brotherhood around
to wit alone passion does fatal prove
i bow me to her shade
he did not like to be in debt
and scarce a fish pops up his sleepy head
all need requires is in that cot contain'd
from pole to pole the rigid influence falls
my ravish'd soul with secret wonder fraught
all nature feels her renovating sway
in vain fair genius bids the laurel shoot
hell groans beneath above they pierce the skies
stain their fierce claws or dip their tongue in gore
enrag'd he smote his breast his clothes he rent
say is it an hibernian bog
his bow unbent hangs negligently by
welcome then little friend to me
but still this fond this faithful heart
with feast regale our garter'd youth again
cent'ring at last in having none at all
he greater glory and more fame obtains
and hid'st in wreaths of flowers his bloodless sword
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
their brawny arms the glowing anchor beat
then fearless of the waves the oceanbreez
still in my eyes be twentyone
that gravely lecture ere they know mankind
when with the chace fatigued he quits the wood
or here to sit wi' chittering wing
each moment has its sickle emulous
and force that sun but on a part to shine
our sober meal dispatch'd with silent haste
the happy gardens of adonis lay
from thee their lustre drew since taught by thee
which the clear concave of a winter's night
unmov'd triumphant scorning death
bleat out afresh ye hills ye mossy rocks
such writers and such readers owe the gust
behold the fiends of strife avenge their wrongs
were half conceal'd and half expos'd to sight
ingulphing more than founded roman ways
at noon i slept a serpent's sudden hiss
yes thou mayst eat thy bread and lick the hand
they all the pleasures of the deep improv'd
or make me so composure is thy gift
meekey'd sedate and gaining every look
of these she heard yet bore to hear
as in debate how best their powers allied
but heaven thought otherwise o generous world
his talk was now of tythes and dues
behold obedient to their great command
'tis she alone that can the mystery tell
and turning to the prince their horses haunches
the softer lyre his gloomy sorrows charm'd
his prince is straightway shut up in his tomb
'till time has stol'n away the slighted good
there 'mid poppies red and blue
which to her fate shall owe her bloom
a poet fond of nature and your friend
good friend forbear you deal in dang'rous things
seeks he to prove that woman's vows are vain
will shock his stedfast soul rather debar'd
his mattin beam wide scattering tips with gold
more like a flash of water from a lock
nor dulness lay the realms of genius waste
the sunny sparkling drop i brush
at night did with his master sup
but what alas will helpless pity do
thus nightly robb'd and injur'd day by day
or gathering all the gentle gales that fly
the billows booming o'er his head
in grateful bondage did their limbs entwine
ask not to what his charities amount
that shed fresh sweets for you
shrunk is the sinew'd energy that strung
relentless winter rules with savage sway
when aweful truth unveil'd appears
the trump that shakes the world's repose
as one who long detain'd on foreign shores
exhibits all their trumpery to sale
and jove the fates has ever heard
a still solemnity all nature kept
and warms us mutual to the kind embrace
who plead for love and look for recompense
sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh
scarce travels down light's languid ray
the citymerchant and the country'squire
a bending cypress skreen'd it from the sun
and beauty dazzles with angelic charms
venus comes with her along
and squeamishly she knits her scornful brow
and cosmo own'd them in th' etrurian shade
through depths of ether coasts unnumber'd worlds
knowledge she gives enough to make them know
or hopes of plaudits from our candid judge
grasping at air for what has earth beside
and grieve for nothing but your absent friend
whate'er the form the end is publick good
finish it's length and teach the murd'rous use
my soul at this no apprehension feels
the bursting cloud reiterated roars
sooner that hero's sword the world had quell'd
cares that become my birth and suit my age
that as she knew what best great pan would please
oh would kind heav'n these tedious suff'rings past
tyrants were chang'd but tyranny the same
and winds blow keen where late the blossom grew
while man asserts his wider claim
our ancestry a gallant christian race
discharg'd his rent and brought him home
and the gay woodbine gave a flaunt
or do we grind her still the grand debate
go from this desolated region far
with brighter hues resplendent and portray'd
i am thy rival pleasure i profess
eternal silence keep
witness of joys that shun the sight of noon
let me ye walks your flowery maze pursue
darts her delighted eye and with a smile
sheds a blest radiance o'er my brightening mind
with outspread hair and ghastly feature
i cannot think your love will e'er decline
but to what more indulgent sky
and all the father's candid spirit shone
with your victorious tongue
only in this alike they all are wrong
clorinda's features seem as faint as mine
of late beneath the neighbouring pastures green
of nothing fearful but to reach our praise
in close array tow'rds fanny's tomb
like him whom fable fledged with waxen wings
may heav'n restore thee to these eyes again
the cause of virtue could not be his view
wisely o c enjoy the present hour
o dire effects of war the time has been
by vexing fortune and intrusive pain
flocks herds unpolish'd shepherds and their loves
your solemn rites here comes no foot profane
yet tho' so polish'd florio's breeding
nor let fond poetry misguide thy sight
with many an artless sigh confest
is weak with rank knighterrantries o'errun
and still ye first of human things
divide our incense and divide our pray'r
or to such shapes as grac'd pygmalion's wife
and clouds of smoke upon the canvas rise
or woo with undisturb'd delight
the gentle lovesong gurgling turtles sing
a fragment and the spoutless teapot there
with doleful rumor and sad presage hung
sweet bird that sing'st on yonder spray
the delicate touch flies o'er the trembling strings
see great commanders making war a trade
for never maid more chaste inspired shepherd's song
by all these blooming charms to love betray'd
and superstitious zeal her learn to deify
my dauntless britons came a gloomy few
of sol's beneficence to the infant germ
he within bounds my wandring lambs would keep
and thus his gliding numbers 'gan essay
teach thy enamour'd spirit to disown
with bread sufficient to the day
still in that eye the spark divine
and morning mists that hover'd round the hills
transcends whatever vaunts historic fame
or foil'd in these he opes his ample jaws
whilst all who genius love or cherish art
himself in arms to meet the foe prepares
a copper otho or a scotch baube
and destly could he daunce or pipe along the dale
the starving birds in numerous flocks repair
a wood the growth of many years
and mark'd what each load added to its size
what station charms thee i'll install thee there
met in fierce combat to dispute the prize
the close recesses of the virgin's thought
then sudden waxed wroth and all she knew not why
celestial providence your steps attend
in prostitution sinks the sense of shame
what midnight robber dare invade
with equal love had smote their rival breasts
while fierce in sanguine rage the sons of spain
which without passing thro' the judgment gains
lend lend thine hand o let me view
as spenser his but not with spenser's oar
the deeper dread and more illustrious spoil
ambition loves to tread
like the presumptuous mariner whose sails
whose eyes were wild whose cheek was pale
exert thy voice and wield thy shotless gun
his hardy steed neighs at the sight of lond
if thou o man a stranger art at home
hope like a rainbow brightens by his side
shook from their lowest seat old vaga's stream
hither bright hygeia fly
at once a perriwig and its own hair
from elevation's pinnacle look down
if she inspire and he approve my lays
but griev'd she finds that his replies
the man with ample sums in store
the sculptur'd bust with laurels wreath'd around
then for she did as judges ought to do
with eager hopes we onward bend
then pity my unhappy fate
thus they conceal'd the dreaded danger shun
minute as dust and numberless oft work
and thou o moon bear witness many a night
for you my trees shall wave their leafy shade
say muse what arm the low'ring brothers cleft
sweet are the banks when spring perfumes
the ruffled surge th' incumbent vessel laves
and lost to each ambitious care
or hope a lover by your faults to win
they make us humble and they make us wise
this world and this unrivall'd by the skies
at length soft slumber kindly interven'd
of full effulgent glory whence they flow
or evening skirts with gold the western skies
she keeps the wond'ring world in awe
false is the pompous grief of youthful heirs
from pyrrho down to david hume
while twilight close the vapours drew
these long were mine and these i give to you
and with warm blushes cause her cheeks to glow
but like the dewdrops on a spray
fresh cargoes come fresh longings these create
by salic law the female right deny
now swell'd the bosoms of repining swains
where wretches never sigh in vain
with blooming gold and blushes like the morn
the hungry judges soon the sentence sign
to shun the noisy paths of wealth and fame
no more the wish of man or female boast
the triple purpose in that sickly foul
to notion quite abstract where first begins
deluded truth observ'd the fraud too late
the sentimental trait that mark'd the mind
saints martyrs fathers all call'd fools and knaves
who frown with brow severe
would give relief of bed and board to none
a twoedg'd weapon from her shining case
by promise now and by possession soon
those pleas'd the most where by a cunning hand
thou mightier monarch love commandest all
to give religion her unbridl'd scope
and dawning grace awakes the fervent soul
not sweeter notes whom pope consigns to fame
where on some bold stupendous height
and hopes and fears give conscience all her power
seem'd like a storm to hang upon your brow
see justice judging there in human shape
and give to satire's grasp her vengeful lance
those fiends upon a shaking fen
to all thy ways resign'd
and haunt the mangled mansions once your own
when at his glass the late companion feels
drop sixpence in the housewife's shoe
the shepherd's calm and blameless tent is thine
the ponderous brass in exercise he bore
how near was she to be undone
midst heaps of broken spears and standards lye
upbraiding monuments of soul disgrace
in which opinion says he follows good
'she never brought a thing like this
that crown withheld which they in triumph wore
with the soft thrillings of the tragic muse
o dread this complicated curse and turn
sleepsoothing groves and quiet lawns between
with joyless pace and debtdespairing looks
accept illustrious shade these artless lays
she spake she dy'd her corse was borne
must only satire keep your fancies warm
his powers no more but leans on his allies
a purple harvest on the sunny fields
unkennell'd from the prisons and the stews
to find me sleeping in the senseless grave
instruction and inventing to ourselves
shall faithful to that sacred grove
or peace or war can bring
of fair proportions and of simple grace
ah bibi who of human kind
steep othrys cynthus erix mimas flame
to the lark's call walks o'er the op'ning flow'r
illustrious sage who first could'st tell
whereby the curious passenger may learn
and leave the lessening world behind
less fair was phoebus' chace for unsought fame
and count the pledges of her future peace
restores the verdure of the tarnish'd leaves
a weeping willow bear
of pleasure next the final cause explore
thy boast supreme a wild absurdity
by holy luke and dictates god's commands
and then a sum of money must be gave
and call our neighbour to the feast
safely infolded by a mother's care
your sharp rebuke came safe to hand
bright gift in lavish grace array'd
sports with the suff'rings of the good and great
across his path was rais'd a mossy bed
while music melts the ear and beauty charms the eye
yet more confin'd is pleasure's faithless round
some letter'd charm may still relief supply
and all its native lustre let abroad
so few scarce worth the beldame's hate
was never in a plot my brain's not hurt
and to our mother too make known
he leads the months their wintry round
were all that heav'n required of human kind
from every leaft salubrious dews exhale
tell how adorn'd with every charm they shine
exalts and sets him nearer to the gods
each rival blushing and each heart my own
repentance breathes her humble prayer
so warm with life your pow'rful numbers flow
the monarch lo in transports hurl'd
again to kindle with her sighs
shall falsly blacken or seduce to crimes
where hands are by stern parents ty'd
the houseless rovers of the sylvan world
where southsea merchants fell
unconquer'd cato virtuous in extreme
the creature and the vassal of the pope
life's softest blessings revell'd in her heart
queen of the stately step and flowing pall
nor from the pleasing groves depart
even now the setting sun and shifting clouds
when with a parting dear embrace
but when the balmy spring return'd
would from my arms my rosabel have born
and asks no pow'r but that of pleasing most
to quell the valor of the stoutest heart
what pomp of words what nameless energy
at last deeprooted hatred lewd reproach
shall visit earth in mercy shall descend
fierce rams and panthers break the tatter'd net
and meriting all titles thou hast gain'd
along the dreary vault of night
and willing victims to their gods expire
but i will think he said and shut the door
these and ten thousand follies more
unchang'd affection draws the tie more near
nor trim thy eyebrows with so nice a care
in early days the conscience has in most
thy self in bondage by the victor kept
to give the fire its course thus chaos wild
hence without hopes to be in life repaid
there proof against prosperity awhile
attain that secret harmony which blends
tells him to take a last farewell
how chang'd the scene for what unpardon'd crimes
and vales and dewy lawns
the beauty of the rustic ball
your true ally and friend
sure some return is due from me
are all enchantments in a case like thine
or tinkle in 'change alley to amuse
then brings the favour'd tribes where jordan flows
bless me a packet 'tis a stranger sues
'twas not sincere the fountains of her eyes
forcing accents mutter'd deep
why now the mighty mass of water swells
surintendant des plaisirs d'angleterre
while friends arriv'd in circles gay
to you my vows ascend my altars burn
the golden schemes of folly break
where'er with easy state he pass'd along
the fairy queen like some bright star
that fish is all one vast extended mouth
even they by whom we once were lov'd
suspends the chorus of the spinner's song
mark now in what confusion stoop or stand
tho' some by magic numbers found
methinks i have eternity in view
with tempest black the goodly scene deform'd
and the master stag below
his voluntary pains severe and long
o dismal fiend to thee i give the world
now if you hope to lie in delia's arms
to every nation frugally imparts
reflection calm with retrospective eyes
that breathes thro' mild correggio's line
the stranger bow'd reply in mute respect
a poet's fortune not immense
and live on foreign spoils or dying thin the stage
smooths her mellifluent stream thee beauty thee
gives the ear a rough goodmorrow
the glittering star of eve thank heaven the day is done
who to themselves appear of equal sort
comfort to heighten joy or lessen pain
his works the chief on this terrestrial ball
some then recounted all the arts
pursued the gen'rous luco to the field
and get your letters read them over
for else our simile is vain
and please if any thing could please
nor can compassion with her softest notes
fatigued himself his camels wanting rest
bid nations leagu'd against thee stand aloof
a friendship worthy of my friend
heav'n justly claims the soul it made so fair
alas thou know'st not with what anxious heart
nor the strong tumults of my soul appease
i was a stricken deer that left the herd
but if the patient all controul despise
receives from her both appetite and treat
dost thou in letter'd greece each charm admire
the last of nations now though once the first
who to the yielding maid had vow'd his truth
despair and fell disease and ghastly poverty
nor mirth be wanting as we walk
a knight of eighteen hundred pounds a year
that fans the golden orangegrove
wilt thou receive his parting breath
in arguing too the parson own'd his skill
simple of heart prefers inglorious want
call'd up to pow'r scarce warm on england's throne
and banners wav'd around
chequers the boughs with parian white
confines each merit to itself alone
thus when the feather'd choir first tempt the sky
just in conjecture though 'twere false in fact
their joy breaks forth in carols rude and loud
nor is paul's church more safe than paul's churchyard
knows it at forty and reforms his plan
grateful germania unknown titles frames
takes shape and shews her face divine
yet very rarely dream of thee
my letter seal'd and sent away
and defecates the student's standing pool
of laws to regulate a toast
his pining flock or from the mountaintop
ye treacherous leaders who yourselves in doubt
made tyrants break made kings observe the law
the toils are great but very small the pay
think of that moment you who prudence boast
fair friendship calls thee to my green retreat
with modesty her cheeks are dy'd
the seasons change and nature's face
soon shall the veil these glowing features hide
alive alone in an unactive will
thro' the thick air as at dull distance seen
with sprightly oaths and well dissembl'd lies
oh stun me not with these insipid dreams
imperial britonesse thy kindred aid
when storms descend and adverse surges roar
there on that rock by nature's chissel carv'd
foreign the care and distant the alarms
ere morning suns had drain'd their fragrant dew
and play'd a sprightly beam if born to speech
that cream that bread and butter soak'd in tea
i dare no more but oh too curious maid
that thou shou'd'st ne'er irradiate all the earth
but if to hording thou art bent thy hopes
feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme
approaches nearest to apollo's throne
blooming with rosy smiles they see portray'd
few take from noble blood pretence
and the pine's tastful apple autumn paints
while on thy altars all of human race
my hopes nor talk of ceremonial days
as oft he rises 'midst the twilight path
when back to schiraz' walls he bent his way
with growing strength and evernew delight
to find it stuff'd with brickbats earth and stones
the mingled passions take up all his soul
thus answer'd kind these happy gardens lie
say shall the muse thy patriot sire
this books can do nor this alone they give
the lovely sisters melt upon the rocks
for ever longer than for ever be
and long from winter save the fading green
with heavy heart deplores that luckless hour
with pleasing sorrow move me to survey
or disappointment goads you thus to write
or for an hour defer you destin'd fall
and may i feel thy utmost ire
no boisterous passions rise
what virgins these in speechless woe
soon as you reach the rural shade
and often joining to the drear abode
warm'd and astonish'd at his evening ray
due to the skyes and meant to shine in fields above
madam by fresh intelligence i find
the treach'rous colours in few years decay
to reach his throne as stages of the soul
htry not with jests obscene to force a smile
but who can pardon the persisting fool
the types are real since from them he drew
just as it serv'd his private ends
too fearless thro' the camp of foes you rove
far happier i who well could spare
thus burden'd silent to the oyster steals
then of thy beauty do i question make
on waller's cheek 'tis you bestow
is india free and does she wear her plumed
she hollowing clear directs the wand'rer right
i have no bus'ness there let those attend
with mournful musick fills the lonely glade
to chear the barren soil and spread the fruits
nor food nor shelter in the groves remain
he serves his country recompenses well
thou hast begun auspicious if the soil
their welfare pleas'd him and their cares distrest
her ample volume opens on your view
its tricks the kitten tries
young ganymede a winged angel stands
such recollection of our own delights
preserve the merciful and kind
if a tight damsel chaunc'd to trippen by
with melting lay salute my love
a mortal can be just to me
at first in vales obscure the lyre i strung
her fascination led me thro' the maze
the noontide ray now darts its heat
with prudence choose 'tis nature's genuine voice
meanwhile osmida in amazement lost
but that is not thy calm resort
devours the voice and feasts upon the sound
describe adonis and the counterfeit
which only a parental eye foresees
save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks
still see that smile endearing artless kind
and so convenient does it lay
escap'd from winter's freezing power
when thus the royal goodness spake benign
and tim'rous shadefish the blind haunts pursue
whose guiltless charms pursue no greater end
and all the mother sunk in dumb despair
by bentley's notes my deadliest foes
of this romantick wilderness once stood
thy image through the drowning tear
sweet fancy every attitude restore
and own'd he should have bought not starv'd him
unheard by all but those alone
by native pow'r and energy her own
oh talk of him in solitary glooms
had never yet been sent
nae hinny'd words wi' me prevail
and thought grows giddy at the vast profound
without a creamy smoothness has no charms
than some grave sinners upon english ground
but woodstock's blooming bowers still remain
the sprightly lark's shrill matin wakes the morn
still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure
and use was taught by elegance to please
the lovely ministress of truth and good
and shake their sables in the wearied eye
vain dreams reply'd the wily youth deceive
will not thy native isle deride
fair venus met the charming queen of love
hard was the lot of her first fav'rite man
music shall penetrate the dust
and the whole race ah too unpity'd dies
far from her hearth was seen to speed away
and free from ev'ry taint but that of vice
and hail with musick its propitious ray
and the welchmen all flock'd and view'd her
with eager soul seizes the valued prize
the king the hero and the man complete
grant man immortal and thy scorn is just
is fulvia crown'd the queen of half an hour
congenial call me from the toilsome page
yet all to reach the arduous summit try
nature enchanting nature in whose form
loose revelry and riot bold
eager she view'd the wave
like quicksilver the rhet'ric they display
in grateful intervals of soft repose
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
we pass a gulph in which the willows dip
with eager speed he sought the trembling maid
it ne'er descends to trifle with mankind
with hideous joy pale orcus rung
see there thy paramour's just fate
yet not too long in cold debate remain
our errors purg'd our faults repented
forms opens and gives scent to ev'ry flow'r
do minds grow up and flourish oft misled
and left her debt to addison unpaid
o banks to me for ever dear
to gen'ral use or strong necessity
the raven plumes his jetty wing
diseased drives pain from guilt lights life in death
behold the costly pillars rise
which o'er the wilds his scanty food he pluck'd
ye lovely fair while flowery chaplets bind
and thinks the moon is proud to copy him
round me more and more they glare
by looking on thee in the living day
within these sacred shades serenely mov'd
we thought you without titles great
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
next came the faun in order meet
by a wild grant their all their freedom pass
like birds whose beauties languish half conceal'd
or if in masculine debate he shar'd
while thus he sadly plains in mournful rounds
altho' th' extremest distances you try
and the pale spectres dance
terrify which the moon's paleglimmering rays
to bear it suffer'd shame where'er he went
along whose wild and heathy side
the threats of pain and ruin to despise
that autumn brings commands thee to retreat
and lets us see enough but not be seen
your thoughts unbounded travel with the sun
and each swift moment fled is death advanced
and to my song the distant tribes repair
of all that wisdom dictates this the drift
the verse begun to one lost friend prolong
yet here even here into these black abodes
it points to six to set it by the sun
she there impatient stood
heavy they roll their fleecy world along
to him whose sword performs such wond'rous things
these are thy blessings industry rough power
when persia next o'erturn'd th' assyrian throne
on her i'll gaze when other loves are o'er
the vine faint spiritless forlorn
of saturn's ring bright shines the border
proves that the heart is none of his
the lofty elms in humble majesty
tossings dire heartpiercing moans
a shouting nation where she turns pursues
earth were a rude uncolour'd chaos still
how vile is man how i detest their ways
see flavia see that budding rose
and taught by kind mamma at home
by thee religion liberty and laws
all largely on the scapegoat slave are pour'd
'tis rapture all 'tis extasy
n'ote thy weak sense conceive should i declare
the tale to you to you the bayes belong
then be thy softer wishes mine
beneath the weight of solemn toys to groan
spangled the dewy leaves with trembling gleams
'decorum's turned to mere civility
'mid tyrants undismay'd
at once to raise our reverence and delight
or raise old warriors whose ador'd remains
stamp on his ashes with a dotard's pride
who for the sake of filling with one blast
and think'st thou still thou canst be wise too soon
worlds ever thwarting never interfere
now trod in dust the peasant's scorn
then prethee phillis leave the courts
fear no osficious damsel's broom
where are thy tears too soon they had aroused them
was spread the same of thy disastrous love
transpierc'd thro' honor's frailer shield
but surely not the mimick shape of me
of luxury's allurement whether firm
to ease the loss of beauty's transient flower
when thou to birds do'st shelter give
at that sad hour shall d'arcy lend his aid
to him alone th' expanding bosom beats
is made familiar watches his approach
ah no revolving years in vain depart
ambition's reign is quickly clos'd
tho' howling wolves shou'd with their voices join
but death's at hand let me advise ye
since you're endow'd with a celestial mind
good folks you need not be afraid
even so through brentford town a town of mud
mirth youth and laughter love to meet
thus often unbelief grown sick of life
thus far was right the rest belongs to heav'n
he saw young daphne on the plain
may still seem love to me though alterd new
bedeck'd the crimson curtains of the sky
to gaze at nature in her green array
that knows no measure by the scanty rule
my claycold cell and near the common tread
and still'd the babbling music of her tongue
this known how food and raiment they might give
the grateful flavour of the indian leaf
their merit balanc'd and their tempers weigh'd
companions fly he ne'er cou'd have a friend
with animation passing vulgar souls
polly each morn shall fill our tea
a thousand worlds there's space for millions more
his and the publick interest were the same
point out each path to good success from far
nor join these furies in their chace
where yon scath'd poplar through the window waves
yet by th' unclouded sun are hourly bred
of logic to compose him
to hush my bosom's ceaseless sigh
and buzzing round the leaves incessant move
rising black such those of old
from thee the boon which nature meant
how elevated and how curst
and set to modern tune his ancient song
survey the dome and as the doors unfold
bereft of song and ever cheering green
body and soul like peevish man and wife
despis'd by all or pity'd but by few
when nature bids eject th' enliven'd spawn
through bursting glooms its cheerful beams extend
his broad bald front gave dignity
in active course and curling streams divide
i'm bold to say there s never one
at whose approach inspir'd with equal fires
where providence shall fix our wand'ring feet
the pleasures he had left behind
this favourite good begets peculiar pain
then others for the breath of words respect
admire new beauties not her own
nor cou'd her sex debase her noble mind
would clio seek the most distinguish'd seat
ten starvling hermits suffer less than he
plinlimmon from afar the traveller kens
lie on their laps or wait upon their chair
like an unwilling inmate longs to roam
in childhood youth in manhood or in age
again when moab peace with israel broke
come all ye tender nymphs and sighing swains
when springtide joy pours in with copious flood
hangs out the sun his lustre but for me
but just as if from woes we could not part
but still malignant fate her wish denies
curst of all creatures for compar'd with thee
ready to cast i yawn i sigh i sweat
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
which now alas has laid him low
in private business his commands prevail
ye guardian spirits when such ye see
in which the best and worthiest tremble most
betray his heart and teach thee not to feel
and harp their praises round the throne of love
and those in golden palls who proudly stond
of an old sage to solitude resign'd
she wept she rav'd she tore her hair
beside your evertrickling urn
whilst something still so gay so new
struck at that thought as newawaked i lift
whose warm retreat voracious breams commend
fond venus lose was less divinely sung
and strong to wield all science worth the name
without a thought without a care
their pow'rs how wond'rous and their strength how great
there justice equal with the sovereign reigns
and now the feather'd youth their former bounds
pale care and lank remorse await
but trust me love the raven's wing
look'd on and view'd her mock'ries with a smile
seiz'd fast his hand held out to set them free
what distant land what region can afford
to this one standard make your just appeal
and potent to resist the freezing blast
not falshood so she hasty seiz'd the vest
into a second book thus far
ev'n ormond's head i can frequent no more
the gale informs us laden with the scent
the little loves may loll and dream
if distant charms such gentle thoughts inspire
distracted wanders now the bowery walk
that virtue points to can a life thus spent
by leave to lay his being down
first taught her heart to prove
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
to sway the judgment while he charms the ear
can s no better promise keep
when wensberg was besieg'd beg'd they might go
i ask no dow'r my fortunes to improve
heedless of all their censures he retires
where cooling vapours breathe along the mead
in endless bloom to bid us live
sip round the pail or taste the curdling cheese
there stands a structure of majestick frame
was it for this alas with weary bill
to cruel manhood grew the daring child
and feel a want before it takes a name
he laugh'd and trifled made him welcome there
and willingly i close the deep ensanguin'd scroll
subdue the floating lee pomona's self
their language surely should be bright
and love like jacob tenderly and true
shall chance receive where sweet contentment dwells
god never made an independent man
farewell pale malice and thy hateful train
let go the tastless prey and vulgar treats refuse
o mother of the fireclad thought
with those exalted joys compare
thou ask'st no more than he has power to give
railing at needful ornament depend
for tho' you gain each good man's praise
he sees an awful form appear
i venerate the man whose heart is warm
so mild a nature and so fair a face
lie clouded in the dark historic page
thou roll'st thy thunders long and loud
and hearts in joyless durance bound
patiently present at a sacred song
gives easy entrance to the motley train
and hence delighted let me pass
transparent forms too fine for mortal sight
she guides the finger o'er the dancing keys
known by her sweeping stole of glossy green
to measure all that passes in the breast
the tyrant view'd her with a ghastly look
the calm conceptions of a studious breast
who conquer'd nature shou'd preside o'er wit
redeem our fame and consecrate our age
let pity plead within thy breast
nor let the little mouth inhale
so rarely found and never to be taught
and her flush'd cheeks confess'd at nearer view
tho' one takes tithes and t'other taxes land
of agrippina's race he lived unknown
her fond oblation to your radiant charms
purblind to poverty the worldling goes
my aking eyes involves ag temple soars
thee too the muse should consecrate to fame
conducts her best her fav'rite train
hope ye vain scenes to catch the mind
she visits there each rosyfeatur'd maid
kinder than kindest with soft pity's eye
warbles the thick melodious note
but if thy niggard hands their gifts withhold
satiate with power of fame and wealth possess'd
call'd harmless humour scandalous abuse
by av'rice sphincter of the heart
whatever faith doth please she may receive
now vain you found it to contend
where the dumb murderer guards the sultan's gate
well they reward the toil the sight is pleased
bring muse bring numbers soft and slow
hear the lov'd cadence of her note
that terminates the view yon cloister'd way
if fortune gives what rarely we obtain
the easily persuaded poet cries
took the impression of that charming face
like that which stands fast by the piny rock
and oft behind him skulk'd for great dismay
howe'er thou maist forbid external force
and warm in salutary streams descend
on either bank the land its master knows
the modest virtues mingled in her eyes
nor mean nor haughty be one preacher's praise
admit him was the ready word
left men to take assuming airs from thence
the silver streams that shine along the plain
superior to and quite distinct from sense
of universal empire growing up
the sad remains of wasted life to spare
the best he teaches thee thy self to know
the youth to knowledge unchastis'd by woe
and rooted all who saw the bloody deed
with wonder and amazement on thee hence
to thy unerring censure i appael
had rang'd the alpine snows by chance at morn
discordant elements agree
cete wellpleas'd thus far the tritons heard
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
but reason heard and nature well perused
and gathering all her treasures sweet by sweet
to her own private use convert the spoils
or dote too fondly on the shining ore
his quincunx darkens his espaliers meet
and is there in creation what amidst
here liv'd convers'd and shew'd th' admiring age
can peace to my sad soul restore
her meanest sons secure enjoy their own
when he the sumptuous dome must quit
breed stormy passions which confin'd
be griev'd to see thy palaces in dust
for dido tho' they never knew her
of envy hatred jealousy and pride
with one that loves his home
my friends who never felt the galling load
along their sloping sides supine
methinks secluded from that brow
dulness is ever apt to magnify
e'en christian slaves have shook their chains and gaz'd
home from his morning task the swain retreats
and wakes my heart to all it felt before
which proves thee of celestial race
how easy sits this scheme on human hearts
the whole behold the fair contention glows
nor man pursue the trade of murder near
branded with arbitrary marks of shame
'tis therefore sober and good men are sad
and then redeem'd by loss of fame
points to inscriptions wheresoe'er they tread
is deem'd to totter on the brink of time
the very rooks and daws forsake the fields
th' enraptur'd bard and on the dewsprent turf
the strength of armies or the force of pray'r
stifl'd in raptures e'er they reach my tongue
hence the noisome reptile's prey
have sail'd in sight of this delightful port
from virtue's fount the purest joys outwell
that erst resounded sweet on judah's plains
not blooming paradise could bribe your stay
praise him ye native altars of the earth
they purchase disappointment pain and shame
old troy in peace and plenty smil'd
this seeming mitigation but inflames
o let thine influence on me shine
thro' heaven's illumin'd vault phoenice led
yet friend be careful 'tis a dang'rous sea
did you not see a phantom flit
a blazing glory round lavinia's head
then i reflect ah would i could forget
in different parts what different views delight
on baia's viny coast where peaceful seas
and touch'd the canvas into life
in vain persuade inexorable grief
cold as its theme and like its theme the fruit
and gives to all new turns and chances
with such soft amorous griefs as torture you
at which the monarch frowns with awful eyes
the reins of empire or resign'd or stole
then say since nature's high behest appears
where thy majestic charms my spirit seize
where chanticleer amidst his haram sleeps
and drives them bleating from their sports and food
of pain courts incapacity of bliss
of man in audience with the deity
her lov'd idea and their grief recals
can let the planters purposes unless
and all can taste them minds that have been form'd
not so sapphira her unsully'd strain
thither ye silversounding lyres
he brib'd her footmen and her maids
pleas'd in oppression and in bondage free
enclos'd within its od'rous cells
then those illfavour'd ones whom none
a soreey'd gum of tears the flannel crew
and up th' ascent of heav'n her brilliant host had led
that i'm as great a plague to her
the child is not quite well i see
from the dash'd pane the deluge as it falls
her fancy of no limits dreams
the same his ancient personage to deck
from nonexistence struck by wrath divine
thus he but th'aged sire whose hoary head
for charm'd with heav'nly song this mournful breast
and darts its meaning from the speaking eyes
red in the ranks of chalgrave's field
may some fair eyes my friend thy bosom fire
because his heart bade him say mair
and he that gives conception adds the birth
he boasts but what he can do will you run
'tis safety to be near thee sure and thus
with fierce and envious yet admiring eyes
and threescore year would make the world away
from real friends an undiscover'd foe
whom lowly themes and humble verse delight
more pleasing thoughts and more enliv'ning fires
now in ecstatic visions let me rove
where smiling euston boasts her good fitzroy
three hundred years reecho'd back the prince
and all thy gaudy gildings die away
from scenes where vernal pleasure reigns
no take a tomb more fitting thy desert
and sickly while her champions wear their hearts
she rather widen'd than clos'd up the wound
he in his bosom plac'd a sprig
thus the unhappy youth was heard to moan
then then i rose then first humanity
yes thou and latium once were great
nor rake nor coxcomb was at hand
awake incorruptible and arise
into the carcase of a beau
aspire to win a dang'rous fame in arms
and stretch'd him on the mossy soil
into those traps which men call'd patriots laid
what less than wonders from the wonderful
the well taught philosophic mind
some tread the slippery paths of love's delights
for clear precision all the tongue of gods
and as by stealth with so much softness blend
though 'tis th' antipodes to thinking
and itch most hurts when anger'd to a sore
thy unused beauty must be tombd with thee
all beings should attain their destin'd ends
nor let the phial of thy vengeance pour'd
this view my forward zeal so shocks
when doubting pardon the meek pleading eye
reflected that thy rays inflame the heart
ev'n if my woe her gentle bosom move
to mitigate our grief and pain
see how the flaunting woodbine shades the bank
threaten britannia's guarded shore
while round religious silence reigns
the rankling fetters and revenge prepares
th' increasing prospect tires our wandring eyes
to seek his father brought me this report
seeds justling seeds for room
stretcht at full length the mimick carcass lies
of what is wrong or right or false or true
unerring heav'n with bounteous hand
no wish should loiter then this side the grave
thee paeta death's relentless hand
of various turn for all occasions fit
my prime of life in wand'ring spent and care
by what mysterious fabric of the mind
like rocks of crystal or lapponian snows
is due from man indulged in such a sight
pontifical he wears when hearts sincere
is rather careless of a sister's fame
the heathen world in gloom
then wisdom prostrate lies and fading fame
that half her terrors ended with his words
from the first note the hollow cuckoo sings
the ardent youth prest the unblushing maid
and lodged in bosoms that ne'er dream'd of gain
forbid to utter what her eyes betray'd
my freedom to compleat convinc'd i see
sauntring and slow so had he passed many a day
the sordid wretch secures his claim
where you and i all day might travel
let none presume to fret and squabble
few are the faults we flatter when alone
struck by the hunter's hand with furious pace
his task secure the miner plies
but a desire his blessings to diffuse
belinda far surpast by beauties sheen
which tho' we justly pass our praise on
ye lonely groves and silent woods
peace and esteem is all that age can hope
from noise and nonsense and vain laughter free
still let me gaze and every care beguile
he lives and o'er his brimming beaker boasts
to be pull'd rudely by the breezes
in form a beau so light he trips
if art with flatt'ring wiles pretend
was it for you to load with blame
some pensy chiels a new sprung race
and dare attempt deceiving god most high
listless inactive waiting but the call
when purblind mortals sound the depths of fate
of more than solar glory doubles wide
t' extract from embers by a strange device
fixt in the concave of the pearly shell
his father's num'rous charge to entertain
thy looks perpetual joys impart
bids proud almagro feel her baleful flame
and leaves a blush for every wish to speak
strength in his heart dominion in his nod
bfast to the thread of life annex'd by fame
is poorly imitated after you
with quickest growth now shake the teeming trunc
then copies spread there lies the trick
to watch the state's uncertain frame
when cromwell fought for pow'r and while he reign'd
but now inchants our eyes
school'd by the skies and pupil of the stars
against the stars he thus exclaiming said
and now again with careful hand
should i devote my sister's virgin charms
his axe suspended in his hands
see ballanc'd beams unweary'd move
in paths where virtue dares not tread
in mantle clad of watchet hue
its bursting roots his strength could not withstand
so fram'd so fashion'd for eternity
alas with them her love had been obtain'd
he saw her yield her quiv'ring breath
and taste and nature every power combine
where once the signpost caught the passing eye
but seeks with pious spleen fantastick woes
and now the turnpike gates again
thy own exhausted would reproach my truth
their helpless offspring bid them wish to live
which lifts th' ennobled spirit near to heaven
to act it well and wisely as we can
and chang'd at will the trampled mead
the pure translucent silver wave
here the plain harmless native his small flock
hurls down the demon spleen with pow'rs combin'd
while he attempts to reach the skies
sweet poetry thy heav'ntaught strain
to mend our morals and our taste refine
the gulph is clos'd their cries are heard no more
when fair serena fair i knew
on dorubernian cliffs the muse hath told
stampt on his soul in godlike lineaments
rich in content in nature's bounty rich
that now aspires to hail your nuptial day
to wand'ring sheep resolved to follow none
conscious of many a glass and sage debate
farewell my pasteral pipe and my dear flock
which foam and neigh and proudly spurn the grass
while feeble justice wept her baffled lore
but soon the fatal time must come
that pierce at once the bleeding veins
oft points to epernay's illfated pass
man's mind is in a pit and nothing sees
save the swift salmon of the silver flood
see tortur'd reason how they pare and trim
and draw in crouds from far
some chance perhaps may us divide
you lov'd her hills and led the laureat band
for them your nat'ral judges britons vote
and in soft sounds your grace salutes their ear
your credit nor his innocence again
and endless blessings flow
some traces yet of sorrow might be found
or mark'd the spot where friends had been
and that demands a mind in equal poise
and now he clasp'd her in his arms
when lab'ring tyrians with united toil
in vain the boyne would victory delay
as rapt in vision dart their earnest eyes
to suck the thyme and blooming rose
heav'n shew'd her something like this morning chace
who into being spake them all
'along the heath and near his favourite tree
that bad'st me chuse the still sequester'd grove
to plan his triumphs in the grove
the long lost joy if never to return
here scaro's feed the only kinds that dare
if in that one they've all
slander still prompt true merit to defame
lest love and friendship both should fail
suggested by his restless spleen
nor is again betray'd
let thy springsweetness bland distil
burning with holy lust to know
he said she hastens o'er the bright abodes
nothing prevails with him but merit
behold a parson at thy elbow stands
no more shall charm the sense or lull the soul
the frequency of crimes has wash'd them white
to which the fragrance of the south shall burn
by stout substantial gods of wood and stone
that crisis of all sublunary power
serene and spacious front set the broad seal
must from my good or evil conduct flow
astonish'd shoot into the frozen zone
precepts are often found to fail
let levi's tribe the lay prolong
her every latent glory to his view
and sought the vales and echoing groves among
halfpleas'd contented will i be
while bent this secret charm to find
their inward ails of head and heart
who wantonly transgresses nature's bounds
and sighs and tears and pray'rs despise
he knows the greatest bliss for man design'd
which shews the fleeting form of things
to give our frail existence worth
profusely pour'd on thee while they are left
for seriously around surveying
the fireside chair still set but vacant still
to dream of dinners but to feed on praise
give spenser's clear and shakespear's noble flame
and from your mellowmodulating throats
and sighs perform'd illusive scene
i'll see him too the first i ever saw
a serpent found which for a staff he took
who follow'd him with utmost reach of sight
italian silks or doyley stuffs
paint britannia full of smiles
seems as it is the fountain whence alone
still with th' entraptur'd strains the valleys ring
see grief diffus'd o'er all thy languid mien
rise mira rise and shun the scorching ray
with polish'd brow and rosy cheek
and cease ye insects who to plants unkind
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
dryden will tell you all that past
'could no pomatums save a trembling maid
if still thy cheeks preserve a blush
the lover too shuns business and alarms
sound were my slumbers and my heart at rest
ambition's boundless appetite outspeaks
'ere yet mortality's fine threads give way
on what the hoary starmonger had taught
no silver harps i heard no muse's voice
and took a long farewell and wish'd in vain
but mighty lord remember thou their seed
my wayward heart will learn to feel for thee
disputes though short are far too long
had grace for other sins but none for theirs
such welcome as her house could give
and on my sorrows practise how to write
and truthperplexing metaphysic wits
neat as her dress and polish'd as her brow
but to preserve them bright or clean
fierce simeon thro' the bright apartments flew
well but you've friends in health too pretty sound
that antient seat where majesty display'd
might thaw the icy coldness of thy breast
to honour true devoid of art
his sister to his heart to fold
for why his owner had a house
her words are slavery and her touch is death
the summons of a ruin'd friend
yet by one slight insinuation
prais'd both their songs and thus their songs repaid
and in loose fragments fling them floating round
are guests by right of custom old and young
of those that bear them in whatever cause
how death has triumph'd in so short a space
and guard the point no enemies attack
secure of pleasure free from pain
'twas venus' self he had neglected
from the firm patriot to the whining monk
so well she knows the stamp of eloquence
the forward violet thus did i chide
when hermes from olympus bent o'er earth
and look'd through nature at a single view
doth nature make the prospect vast
upon that great solemnity repair'd
my luco sat and to the wand'ring stars
autumnal days a constant medium boast
if thou be nigh grief's hate is vain
not so when greece's chief by heav'n inspir'd
had faded poetry was not an art
and if his character was clear
rich in the blood which swell'd that patriot's veins
who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath
all glares alike without distinction gay
wing'd flight pale terror discord cloath'd in fire
both where she foams impetuous soil'd with mud
nor turn the pilgrim from my door
she whitening o'er her downs diffusive pours
the letters in the staff may wear away
fir'd by the nodding verdure of its brow
pursue at distance and his steps adore
she rises conscious of her worth
through endless fruitless toils adieu
then such a train and such expence to fit
sleep in the womb of chaos fancy droops
and bid him live for love and thee
still caution warn'd me anxious for the realm
stretch their long arms to join the distant main
and flora cries exulting see my rose
lest sudden onset should his flock surprize
driving snow or drenching rain
his fires when at their height to mine are faint
and bears its flow'ry honours to the sky
to mark the windings of a scanty rill
they hate the shore who sacred honours claim
receives a burden nightly at its door
till some fierce tide with more imperious sway
she penetrates with newton's eye
the plumes are strippd the grisles broke
she deems all safe for she has paid the price
beside that man by some kind dmon taught
for me by nature form'd to judge with phlegm
at this great aera andd the sage decree
with albion's safety lab'ring in his breast
no scythian deigns to bend his bow
howe'er perform'd it was their brightest part
was there expos'd before my wond'ring eyes
look upward to the hill beyond the grove
not poison'd quite by this same villain's bowl
apollo shoot thy parting ray
methinks i see the season onward roll
below the burning waves to hide their heads
and turn the tide of souls another way
which prudence could not shun nor strength withstand
spontaneous rise and blossom in the shade
to pitch the ball into the grounded hat
so i thus doom'd from thee to part
nor doubt with me to tread the downward road
th' oppressor rul'd tyrannick where he durst
the sun had chas'd the mountain snow
but virtue may approve it with a smile
she gave to chance each unschool'd feature
how would the world admire but speaks it less
this conquest triumphs over fame
and charm through distant ages wrapt in shade
i saw the moon fill up her horn
each murmur does my pain increase
the raving priests amazing things divine
three worthy friends o'er all the nation
thro' temp'rate air uninterrupted stray
the livid lightnings flash and elements
ah do not now my wandering footsteeps trace
with joy i started nor approach'd too near
you trust to gain and put an end to strife
but if beneath the favour of mistake
baths theatres and fanes in mould'ring fragments lie
up to the mountain's summit there t' indulge
who to such strange perfection wrought
thou who no change of season knows
long long thy useful life and blessings crown
and all our past campaigns recite
last of the motley bands on whom the pow'r
teach humbler thoughts to you
thought dies and ev'n at last your image fades away
with grotius on newtestament yo've done
reckless ambition that right onwardn wends
here are no wheels for either wool or flax
whether with deep reflection fraught
i in their scenes with borrow'd passion rage
whate'er the' almighty's subsequent command
and o fond foolish man she cry'd forbear
he felt it all the foll'wing day
pretend that christ who came we all agree
a hollow voice for entrance calls
i oft have listen'd to the chat
o glorious queen by nature form'd to bring
in yonder shade whilst harriet's urn we place
and perfect speaker onslow past dispute
her beauties well supply'd each tragic lore
a stain to all but most a stain to kings
virtue alone has majesty in death
rush'd to the cliff and having reach'd it stood
or man survives the grave or own lorenzo
othello richard hamlet lear

numbers innumerable wellconceived
thy silver dishes for thy meat
the wanton dolphins joyous danc'd around
thou who magnanimous could'st bear
and 'gainst a pulpit run my head
the solitary shilling pardon then
thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox
and urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry
my verse will like my sighs be numberless
to what i was twice nothing and much woe
in borrow'd lustre from a higher sphere
try now the merits of this blest exchange
what tho' th' almighty's regal throne be rais'd
to form thy tender mind to virtue prone
benign return'd her amiable son
propitious fates preserve them safe
which sent his keenest surest dart
those dip their crooked beak in kindred blood
the youth cry'd out o thrice renowned mage
all my reproof thy wanton thoughts restrain
dolphins like men perform the nuptial debt
shew'd the proud infidel his suit was vain
he asks how vast must be that giant's size
the stagyrite who rules from nature drew
which nauseate all and nothing can digest
i know her strength but will not change my side
rolls the rich stream of wide munificence
falls hoarse from steep to steep in close array

unstudy'd truth which few alas can bear

o portents constru'd on our side in vain
in vain corruption sheds her golden dews

that with bareheaded and obsequious bows
around their tomb in generous sorrow mourn

shut from the common air and common use
and softly sooth the pensive fair
each neried strait her sea green tresses tares
but these like that fallen monarch when reclaim'd

with courtship pleas'd of silly toasters proud
and wildly warbling scatter'd as they flew

and each cold secret of the fishers toil
and wars and conquests fill th'important year

and those in rings beneath the greenwood shade
nor balmy air nor healthful exercise
and how they used their passive prey
when out of dark confusion sprung
supreme in wit supreme in play

while serious souls are by their fears undone

oft have i strove to burst the yielding planks
whose lays the soul with noblest passions move
than break his plighted faith nor fear nor hope

o thou whose powerful voice

which he not knowing how to prize
to stem the troubled wave
blush for hypocrisy if not for guilt
her native sense improv'd by reading
who wisely come to mend their fortunes here
he took and bred her with indulgent care
while luckless harbingers with odious yell
lawlicens'd prostitutes for gold
his post not mean his talents not unknown
and piercing cold mocks the declining sun
with like participation wherefore then
'tis true of old the patriarch spread
dig for the whither'd herb thro' heaps of snow
from infancy through childhood's giddy maze
array'd in nature's liv'ry gaily green
rough thetis' self assumes a pleasing smile
meant not such men as live to dine
was by that wizard ty'd a magick chain
at length to ev'ry gazing eye appears
to knot to twist to range the vernal bloom
by the rude storm despoil'd of peace and fame
how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow
when evening comes she comes with all her train
can ruling heav'n the same endowments lend
and goodness cast a smile on all around
the neighb'ring swains to grace the nuptial rites
he will because it is by him endued
no need he cries of gravity stuff'd out
or in mere nothing if my being ends
with looks demure and silent pace a dunn
in grief's soft moments steal around his asking breast
'tis the malignancy of low desire
in that alas we know there's less
shall loudly thunder in thy ear
though winter had been none had man been true
where nature guides and virtue rules
here hills and vales the woodland and the plain
'till my diminish'd house was hid from view
and round the world her long dark curtain throws
blithe plenty with her loaded horn
scarce keeps his own hereditary snows
joy flush'd her brow and expectation swell'd
to mark what triumphs wait the night
to mix with ocean's undistinguish'd tide
the line too labours and the words move slow
half blind with rage and mad with pain
once when the sky was up in arms
or hide its horrors from the springing day
perish the thought ye slaves of gold away
come with all that freeborn grace
could match the numbers of its pigmy race
and all so fine adjusted that the loss
the common care that waits on all beside
ah friend forbear nor fright the fields
and join'd forgetful of his country's claims
and hollows to his offspring from sulphurious stores
'go seek your pillow and be still
with one small mess himself and that sustains
while bright in arms and of gigantic size
they die fell serpents in his dawning reign
at length we found two rows of aged firs
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
or knave to wrong or madman to destroy
that owls at midnight nod in ivy chair
of aught in nature or in art
from god's best nature good in grain
that cruel something common to the rest
which path was best to shun or which pursue
and promises perennial bloom

her death invades his mournful right and claims
but what have i of comfort lost
its central sun around whence iris steals
she smiles appearing as in truth she is
with that he brast into a scornful laugh
shall all our knowledge be those names to know
oh think that on the distant heath
than to adore the glories they commend
dispense abroad names that to latest time
the jarring seasons brought on various teen
look where thy saviour fills the middle space
why think we these less pleasing to behold
before the throne ambrosial incense burns
there let the bridegroom stay
for property stripp'd off by cruel chance
to paint the charms ofd sion's sacred place
will curb an angry wit
drops from the lips a disregarded thing
and leave awhile his blissful groves
no art averts this pest on thee it lyes
lo arm'd with whirlwind hail and frost
your coolness now no more invites
their resolution fails their pinions still
while pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave
bitters and sweets in the same cup are thrown
where all the motherwaters silent flow
ere you the avenue approach
of all the darkest if at death we die
love makes the music of the blest above
a sea where man perpetually is tost
that drove them to the bell
that life enlivens and exalts it's powers
he lov'd the placid rill that feeds the flowers
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
and blusht and fainted at the soft surprize
but flies subdu'd to albion's utmost shore
then seems as dipp'd in cloister'd dews
that all contribute to the general bliss
for such a phrenzy no defence is
for future vacancies in church or state
sink in oblivion with the nameless crew
to snatch the glorious deed nor trebia quell'd
that poor jonquil with almost ev'ry breath
like maids of honour at a masquerade
delia may be unkind and faithless too
the youth by concord led in secret hy'd
alive and happy 'tis not joy to her
to build the temple of their muchlov'd god
my soul in prison seem'd to be
could tempt those vandalrobbers forth
sir elmer's javelin stood
false are the dice when gamesters stamp the board
where'er i fly fresh grief my steps pursue
the future shone disclos'd and in long view
when aristides rul'd and cimon fought
muscle and nerve miraculously spun
safely to shelter the expected fair
and news much older than their ale went round
and justice vainly each expedient tries
near the rush'd marge of cherwell's flood
won by the ravage of a butcher'd world
the anxious hen for her young brood in dread
and thus alternately their grief they mourn'd
stands on an equal footing with the great
or slender ancle white and neat
while lasts the mountain or while thames shall flow
alfred auspicious name say goddess say
he heap'd up such an ample store
if born blest heirs of half their mother's tongue
then join the general chorus of all worlds
with firm unweary'd arm the dangerous fight
that their whole fate for many a year
that plague which in her whispers low
that dims the dawn of being here below
as set the midnight riot in a blaze
perhaps you in the dust have laid
behold the estimate at large
what does he mean is this a play
trembling i wak'd with sweet excess of joy
all the fair series of the whisker'd race
then paternoster done
from offer'd light in selfsufficience wise
if fame in arms with ancient birth combin'd
a liquid altar to thy praise
and spurr'd their horses headlong through the glades
within the knowledge of mine own desert
enabling us to think in higher style
so firm in friendship and so fond in love
man makes a death which nature never made
full slowly tolling instruments of trade
my panting soul can bear no more
daemons and goblins thro' the dark air shriek
from infancy to age alike appears
as london ladies owe their shape to stays
their usual walk with pleasing tales she strove
they follow wheresoe'er i lead
from their long slumber from earth's heaving womb
no pompous grandeur there adorns the grove
the sable queen of shades retires
when to the fam'd cecropian shore
thine shall with more distinguish'd ardors burn
i ne'er design'd it for a banishment
then be this grave my bridal bed
speechless the mourning mother heard
the horrid helmet strikes my soul unbid
cares do still their thoughts molest
return'd and saw her vessels fill'd
thus unobnoxious to detraction's aim
he steer'd securely and discover'd far
and thro' their flowing mantles thin
and bless the storms that blow'd me to this isle
let me tho' lawyers may perhaps forbid
whose grotto stands upon the topmost rock
thou'lt know indeed it answers with a groan
then would i sing the sons of fame
what for my friend my soldier shall i frame
yet still beneath the throne unbrib'd she sate
but asking what the symptoms were
loose not too much the reins to wild desire
i come i come my jamie dear
descend to earth and wander by the stream
who in thick darkness mak'st thy dread abode
and still the tumults of thy ruffled breast
richly paint the vernal year
'shall i reject her or obey
thro' all the radiant paths of time
so nice his ear so delicate his touch
and gently move the jess'mine's fragrant wing
and thunderbolts excepted quite a god
this stamps the paradox and gives us leave
one truth amid your numerous schemes mislaid
of sabbath bells he hears at sermon time
to sing o muse the pious bard inspire
and yet that face forsake
had thought been all sweet speech had been denied
but now he fell a victim to the snare
by nature haughty and to vice inclin'd
her guiltless soul was like her person fair
whilst i thy wond'rous fabric stare at
let them with simple whitehead taught to creep
let me thy palm tho' not thy laurel share
to spring aloft and reach yon happy land
and chase we still the phantom through the fire
shall never nature yield to art
oft did the harvest to their sickle yield
but gaze and touch and peep and peep again
i hid this coin when charles was swaying
and planetary some what gave them first
of heav'ndescended poesy
the rout is folly's circle which she draws
unheard perchance the nursling lifts his voice
with double rapture hails these first delights
'twas with regret the sword of rage i drew
and gaz'd himself to balmy rest
when pious kings enjoy'd the shepherd's ease
ere yet their charms were flown
oh let not me offend unbidden waiter
'whose feet unhallowed thus intrude
no more their livid lightnings play
exult in love from lovers they despise
and ten lean servants at my call
and where the face of nature laughs around
then vanish quite away still night succeeds
of bright ideas flowers of paradise
or ripen swellings where no sores are found
cannot by change to greater excellencies rise
and how you taught me artfully to swim
return enchanting looks and tender sighs
whom still with unslack'd hate we view and still
yet like the mustering thunder when provok'd
to you athenians we again submit
when satan with his pow'rs shall sink to endless doom
how joy the seraphs in their brighter skies
and set 'em in a due degree
and then to pass the livelong sunday off
and though himself so polish'd still reprieves
when england's genius hovering o'er inspir'd
with steady finger points us to our home
nor is it blind necessity alone
where by his darts the crested python slain
tho' drest in savage guise approach thou son
tho' now the fashion's out of date
with charms attractive shapes her faultless form
increase the soft distress
no quoth the man of broken slumbers
by reason prompted passion had no part
than in a churchman slovenly neglect
whom sunny borneo bears are stor'd with streams
that manly limb requir'd and sinews tough
my lord may take you to his bed
when first she throws her quiv'ring ray
theirs the wild chase of false felicities
spread in all realms the cowardice the pride
to add fresh comforts to their night's repose
fye naughty fop where e'er you come
the various workings of the virtuous soul
to thine whose ruthless heart has caus'd my pains
atone for years in absence lost
how oft my palfry stumbled in the way
fromu carpenter we guess or see
of morbid hue his features sunk and sad
the drooping train of arts to cherish and adorn
ere diff'rent mixtures left no form the same
thou to her friends the beauteous maid restore
on her britannia's muchlov'd isle
unmov'd they stretch themselves and longing wait
and unsuspecting on a sister queen
on nobler views intent the sage's mind
though night unnumber'd worlds unfolds to view
within your ground be seen
yet still he sues with suppliant hands and eyes
the thin disguise of this most florid speech
though silent long and sleeping ne'er so sound
'another year with promis'd blessings rise
and monkish legends been their only strains
her joy in gilded chariots when alive
to sing of nature as we pleas'd survey
yet mark yon spectre's gloomy air
or hov'ring in the troubled air
beneath the frozen clod all seeds of herbs
worse as more close the disingenuous art
her flow'ry chaplets on thy boughs
from well stor'd horn rich grain and timely fruits
sweet may her fame to late remembrance bloom
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
nor leave remembrance of their fancy'd worth
but beams sage horace from each strain of thine
attuning all their passions into love
or craggy coasts just rising into view
with joys to honour never foes
and if selfinterest be but in the case
go distant shores and brighter conquests seek
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year
like noah's dove my busy breast
no ease th' envenom'd flesh receives
till you so oft your amorous crimes repeat
now woo them wed them bind them to thy breast
i spy a freckle on your brow
songs of chiefs and heroes old
within augusta's walls twice have we felt
when the full town to joy invites
and soft as summer or the western wind
and how to make a mighty people thrive
where love or fancy leads
the orient orb that watch'd my natal hour
and with thine anguish bring thy joy
that town so fam'd in lent for figs
of flattery seems so much afraid
and schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands
replete with heavenly love
thy various seasons in their author's mind
at once with dullness and with hunger curst
what means this awful sight why round me shine
her tender husband wond'ring much
guiltless the moments of this plain have run
when offer'd by the lowly meek and poor
with rising or with setting sun
trifler wilt thou sing till june
is blockhead coxcomb puppy fool and sot
to build by verse as heretofore
nor is so sure a bloodhound found in hell
those plains where in unguarded hour
the bellying sails will whiten all your channel
or had he been to ton less true
unless my damon should appear
of the sole being right who spoke the word
the heart that burns with slighted fires no more
but free and pure the grateful current flows
on blessings unenjoy'd
press not for what i must deny
embolden'd will i speak my flame nor thou
those real charms for which you're fam'd
he was to weet an old and wrinkled mage
pleasures less fierce more lasting more sincere
they hear no sound but the endearing voice
say poyntz amidst the toils of anxious state
the basis on which love of glory builds
whose stygian throats breathe darkness all day long
view'd in each light the simple village life
with eyes dejected and with visage pale
those call him loudly to pursuit of more
in vain a powerful duty bids us part
the missive weapon trembl'd on the ground
thank heaven i knew thee not i ne'er shall feel
to shed a tear on their vicegerents awful tomb
the dryads swift that roam the woods
thou fool will thy discov'ry of the cause
a heart of softer workmanship than stone
with swelling thoughts fixt on his great intent
no language but the language of the heart
ye thrones dominions virtues pow'rs
why o'er this stream that deep and black appears
then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show
brighteyed fancy hovering o'er
whilst i alas am left forlorn
so did azuriel's arm if fame say true
conduct to britain's blooming king
when heat or thirst to flowing streams invite
and all its social cares renew
grandclimacterical absurdities
tell me my patroness and friend
a dream while foulest foes found welcome there
let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn
hear this ye nymphs but hear and tremble too
where for awhile his fond paternal care
her scanty stock of brushwood blazing clear
how sweet to recall the sweet moments of joy
'tis this and this only can absence employ
can ease my fond heart and beguile my soft pain
till i see with delight my dear charmer again
ah who ever knew such full transports as i
while with her the swift minutes unheeded pass'd by
alas with the sweet recollection i burn
bring back your delights ye dear moments return
ah me what delights in my bosom would rise
while with eager attention i've hung on her eyes
and watch'd the kind beams of compassion and love
while she pitied my passion and seem'd to approve
ah me with what raptur'd attention i've hung
to catch the sweet accents that flow'd from her tongue
when tenderness bade the dear maiden impart
the pleasing sensations that glow'd in her heart
o how does my fair one consume the long day
is the charmer quite easy while i am away
indeed if our thoughts like our hearts should agree
the dear lovely maiden is thinking on me
ah did she but think with such fondness as i
how much would she grieve and how oft would she sigh
yet with so much fond love may her bosom ne'er burn
if she fighs as i sigh if she mourns as i mourn
but why do i wander why sigh thus alone
alas 'tis the loss of my fair that i moan
why thus every hour does my sorrow increase
alas it is absence that ruins my peace
why swells my sad bosom with fear and with grief
ah nought but her presence can bring me relief
why thus down my cheek trickles fast the big tear
alas can i help it my fair is not here
till i nourish'd this passion i all unconcern'd
saw peace my companion wherever i turn'd
till now with my heart all at ease i could rest
and a sigh was a stranger unknown to my breast
what then is this love and why do i endure
these griefs in my mind nor endeavour to cure
when thus my fond heart is o'erwhelm'd with despair
and i know no delight when away from my fair
yet colin these pains spite of all thou hast said
by one hour of her presence are far overpaid
these sorrows from absence which now you deplore
then vanish are lost and are thought of no more
recall those rash words and forbear to complain
since the next tender meeting rewards all your pain
let sweet expectation then lessen your care
let hope soften absence and keep off despair
sure sure those dear pleasures once more will return
how long in this absence distrest must i mourn
how long must i wish while my lot i deplore
that dear angelface could i see it once more
that dear angelvoice time how swift didst thou seem
while i listen'd enchanted as love was her theme
o come those dear hours and to soothe my fond pain
love again be her theme and i listen again
how dull and how slow do the moments retreat
time was when they flew now there's lead on their feet
ye loiterers be gone why so long do ye stay
ye fly when i'm with her ye creep when away
ah colin how foolish time's progress to blame
his paces are equal his motions the same
'twas the joy of her presence made time appear fleet
'tis the pain of her absence adds lead to his feet
it blew an hard storm and in utmost confusion
the sailors all hurried to get absolution
which done and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd
was transfer'd as they thought from themselves to the priest
to lighten the ship and conclude their devotion
they toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean
as near portobello lying
on the gently swelling flood
at midnight with streamers flying
our triumphant navy rode
there while vernon sate allglorious
from the spaniards' late defeat
and his crews with shouts victorious
drank success to england's fleet
on a sudden shrilly sounding
hideous yells and skrieks were heard
then each heart with fear confounding
a sad troop of ghosts appear'd
all in dreary hammocks shrouded
which for windingsheets they wore
and with looks by sorrow clouded
frowning on that hostile shore
on them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre
when the shade of hosier brave
his pale bands was seen to muster
rising from their watry grave
o'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him
where the burford rear'd her sail
with three thousand ghosts besides him
and in groans did vernon hail
heed oh heed our fatal story
i am hosier's injur'd ghost
you who now have purchas'd glory
at this place where i was lost
tho' in portobello's ruin
you now triumph free from fears
when you think on our undoing
you will mix your joy with tears
see these mournful spectres sweeping
ghastly o'er this hated wave
whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping
these were english captains brave
mark those numbers pale and horrid
those were once my failors bold
lo each hangs his drooping forehead
while his dismal tale is told
i by twenty sail attended
did this spanish town affright
nothing then its wealth defended
but my orders not to fight
oh that in this rolling ocean
i had cast them with disdain
and obey'd my heart's warm motion
to have quell'd the pride of spain
for resistance i could fear none
but with twenty ships had done
what thou brave and happy vernon
hast atchiev'd with six alone
then the bastimentos never
had our foul dishonour seen
nor the sea the sad receiver
of this gallant train had been
thus like thee proud spain dismaying
and her galleons leading home
though condemn'd for disobeying
i had met a traitor's doom
to have fallen my country crying
he has play'd an english part
had been better far than dying
of a griev'd and broken heart
unrepining at thy glory
thy successful arms we hail
but remember our sad story
and let hosier's wrongs prevail
sent in this foul clime to languish
think what thousands fell in vain
wasted with disease and anguish
not in glorious battle slain
hence with all my train attending
from their oozy tombs below
thro' the hoary foam ascending
here i feed my constant woe
here the bastimentos viewing
we recal our shameful doom
and our plaintive cries renewing
wander thro' the midnight gloom
o'er these waves for ever mourning
shall we roam depriv'd of rest
if to britain's shores returning
you neglect my just request
after this proud foe subduing
when your patriot friends you see
think on vengeance for my ruin
and for england sham'd in me
then sleep for an hour or two and no more
at nine stretch your arms and oh think when alone
there's no pleasure in bed mary bring me my gown
slip on that ere you rise let your caution be such
keep all cold from your breast there's already too much
your pinners set right your twitcher ty'd on
your prayers at an end and your breakfast quite done
retire to some author improving and gay
and with sense like your own set your mind for the day
at twelve you may walk for at this time o' the year
the sun like your wit is as mild as 'tis clear
but mark in the meadows the ruin of time
take the hint and let life be improv'd in its prime
return not in haste nor of dressing take heed
for beauty like yours no assistance can need
with an appetite thus down to dinner you sit
where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit
let this be indulg'd and let laughter go round
as it pleases your mind to your health 'twill redound
after dinner two glasses at least i approve
name the first to the king and the last to your love
thus cheerful with wisdom with innocence gay
and calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day
the dews of the evening most carefully shun
those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun
then in chat or at play with a dance or a song
let the night like the day pass with pleasure along
all cares but of love banish far from your mind
and those you may end when you please to be kind
shepherd seek not wealth nor power
let the verdant woodbine bower
and the hills and vales and trees
and the lonely cottage please
can the gaudy gilded room
vie with fields in vernal bloom
or italian airs excel
plaintive tuneful philomel
can the futile arts of dress
grace thy modest shepherdess
happier in her humble sphere
than the daughters of the peer
'midst the city's tempting glare
dwell disease and strife and care
quit not then the farm or fold
nor exchange thy peace for gold
alexis the pride of the plain
beside a clear brook lay reclin'd
his complaint was fair daphne's disdain
who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind
his flock was no longer his care
his pipe now no longer could please
he neglected his dress and his hair
and by solitude fed his disease
poor shepherd he wildly exclaim'd
alas what avails all thy moan
the joys thy fond fancy had fram'd
with daphne for ever are flown
how could you o daphne deceive
a swain not unworthy your love
why didst thou alexis believe
such a maid could thy passion approve
her form is replete with each grace
the diamond beams forth in her eye
the lily expands o'er her face
and the rosebud imparts its soft dye
no warbler can rival her song
philomela with envy complains
the streams glide in silence along
the glad zephyrs diffuse her soft strains
when daphne appear'd in the mead
her presence enliven'd the morn
now the winds roughly blow round my head
and the sun's chearful beams are withdrawn
no longer these meadows look green
now the warblers abandon the grove
the air breathes no longer serene
all summer is fled with my love
oh daphne you heard my fond sighs
you did not my passion disdain
when i gaz'd with delight on your eyes
my soft glances you did not restrain
but now you make sport of my woes
and laugh at the sufferings i feel
i enjoy not the sweets of repose
nor can i my torments conceal
farewell ye sad scenes of my love
i shall never revisit you more
adieu to the mead an he grove
'twas here i first learn'd to adore
i will banish this wretch from her sight
i know not what fate may ensue
never more can i taste of delight
to every enjoyment adieu
with a torrent of heartbursting grief
alexis continues his moan
tears gave him some little relief
yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan
pastora by chance hasten'd by
she saw the poor shepherd's despair
soft pity appear'd in her eye
she ask'd him the source of his care
what cause has alexis to weep
with looks of compassion she said
have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep
or is tray the poor favourite dead
or perhaps your fair daphne's unkind
perhaps for her coyness you grieve
ah 'tis jealousy poisons your mind
but appearances often deceive
the shepherd just rais'd up his head
he thank'd the kind maid for her care
he confess'd that all comfort was fled
and nothing was left but despair
pastora e'en wept at the tale
and wish'd she could ease his distress
could her interest with daphne prevail
his suffering should soon find redress
he gaz'd on the fair with surprize
and admir'd the goodnature she shew'd
when she went he withdrew not his eyes
but with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd
her sweetness her beauty and truth
with daphne's late falshood compar'd
so charm'd so astonish'd the youth
that his heart for a change was prepar'd
yet still his fond wish would arise
ah was but my daphne thus kind
i would wipe off these tears from my eyes
and give up my sighs to the wind
he said and arose from the ground
then instant return'd to his cot
soon in sleep every suffering was drown'd
and daphne's unkindness forgot
with the sun the next morn he arose
pastora he sought in the grove
he repeated the tale of his woes
and mourn'd the sad fate of his love
pastora heard every complaint
again he imparted his grief
he talk'd without fear or constraint
and found from her converse relief
the friendship he felt for the fair
each meeting still serv'd to improve
he then blest his late cause of despair
and became a true votary to love
'twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd
he no longer to merit was blind
'twas his joy and a laudable pride
that he valu'd the charms of the mind
pastora with blushes confest
that she felt all the force of true love
but that reason her passion supprest
yet that now she must own and approve
she soon gave her hand to the swain
who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth
he had met a reward for his pain
more lasting than beauty and youth
when spring decks with verdure the mead
love wafts milder fragrance around
when summer invites to the shade
love strews with fresh flowrets the ground
in autumn thro' cornfields they rove
and their loves as in springtime appear
tho' winter disrobes the known grove
yet their love varies not with the year
ye nymphs to this maxim attend
tho' beauty awhile may allure
yet to fix in the lover the friend
'tis virtue alone is secure
ye swains who are caught by a face
know that beauty will quickly decay
that virtue still heightens each grace
and imparts more than time steals away
on the banks of that crystalline stream
where thames oft his current delays
and charms more than poets can dream
in his richmond's bright villa surveys
fair ella of all the gay throng
the fairest that nature had seen
now drew every village along
from the day she first danc'd on the green
ah boast not of beauty's fond power
for short is the triumph ye fair
not fleeter the bloom of each flower
and hope is but gilded despair
his affection each swain now behold
by riches endeavours to prove
but ella still cries what is gold
or wealth when compar'd to his love
yes allen together we'll wield
our sickles in summer's bright day
together we'll lease o'er the field
and smile all our labours away
in winter i'll winnow the wheat
as it falls from thy flail on the ground
that flail will be music as sweet
when thy voice in the labour is drown'd
how oft would he speak of his bliss
how oft would he call her his maid
and allen would seal with a kiss
every promise and vow that he said
but hark o'er the grasslevelc land
the village bells sound on the plain
false allen this morn gave his hand
and ella's sond tears are in vain
sad ella too soon heard the tale
too soon the sad cause she was told
that his was a nymph of the vale
that he broke his sond promise for gold
as she walk'd by the margin so green
which befringes the sweet river's side
how oft' was she languishing seen
how oft' would she gaze on the tide
by the clear river then as she sate
which reflected herself and the mead
awhile she bewept her sad fate
and the green turf still pillow'd her head
there there is it ella i see
'tis ella the lost undone maid
ah no 'tis some ella like me
some hapless young virgin betray'd
like me she has sorrow'd and wept
like me she has fondly believ'd
like me her true promise she kept
and like me too is justly deceiv'd
i come dear companion in grief
gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu
i come and we'll gather relief
from bosoms so chaste and so true
like you i have mourn'd the long night
and wept out the day in despair
like you i have banish'd delight
and bosom'd a friend in my care
ye meadows so lovely farewel
your velvet still allen shall tread
all deaf to the sound of that knell
which tolls for his ella when dead
your wish will too sure be obey'd
nor allen her loss shall bemoan
soon soon shall poor ella be laid
where her heart shall be cold as your own
then twin'd in the arms of that fair
whose wealth has been ella's sad fate
as together ye draw the free air
and a thousand dear pleasures relate
if chance o'er my turf as ye tread
ye dare to affect a fond sigh
the primrose will shrink her pale head
and the violet languish and die
ah weep not fond maid 'tis in vain
like the tears which you lend to the stream
tears are lost in that watery plain
and your sighs are still lost upon him
scarce echo had gather'd the sound
but she plung'd from her grassspringing bed
the liquid stream parts to the ground
and the mirror clos'd over her head
the swains of the village at eve
oft meet at the darkspreading yew
there wonder how man could deceive
a bosom so chaste and so true
with garlands of every flower
which ella herself should have made
they raise up a shortliving bower
and sighing cry peace to her shade
then handlock'dinhand as they move
the greenplatting hillock around
they talk of poor ella and love
and freshen with tears the fair ground
nay wish they had never been born
or liv'd the sad moment to view
when her allen could thus be forsworn
and his ella could still be so true
in the dead of the night when with labour oppress'd
all mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest
cupid knock'd at my door i awoke with the noise
and who is it i call'd that my sleep thus destroys
you need not be frighten'd he answered mild
let me in i'm a little unfortunate child
'tis a dark rainy night and i'm wet to the skin
and my way i have lost and do pray let me in
i was mov'd with compassion and striking a light
i open'd the door when a boy stood in sight
who had wings on his shoulders the rain from him dripp'd
with a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd
i stirr'd up my fire and close by its side
i set him down by me with napkins i dried
i chaf'd him all over kept out the cold air
and i wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair
he from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease
but taking his bow up he said if you please
we will try it i would by experiment know
if the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow
forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew
to the string he apply'd it and twang went the yew
the arrow was gone in my bosom it center'd
no sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd
away skipp'd the urchin as brisk as a bee
and laughing i wish you much joy friend quoth he
my bow is undamag'd for true went the dart
but you will have trouble enough with your heart
sue venal belinda to grant you the blessing
as jove courted danae or vain's your addressing
for love she asserts all that's generous inspires
and therefore rich tokens of love she requires
such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting
will ne'er reach elysium but ever be coasting
like pennyless ghosts deny'd passage by charon
they'll find without fee unrelenting the fair one
but give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing
who love pays with love and caresses with cooing
by whom a true heart is accepted as sterling
and cupid alone makes her lover her darling
ye myrtles and woodbines so green
ye bow'rs that with rapture i've seen
when his heart beat with every look
when he left both his pipe and his crook
each hour he employ'd for his dear
the sweet bryar and violet did rear
with roses and hiacynths fair
sweet chaplets he wove for her hair
at noon's scorching heat we retir'd
or else to the wood he admir'd
with his song did the shepherd delight
my steps did the charmer invite
but ah to my sorrow i find
that damon is false as the wind
with scorn doth he slight all my charms
with hatred he flies from my arms
the garland he wove for my hair
the crook that he bought at the fair
the bow'r which for delia he made
of the grot and the silver cascade
my flocks can no longer delight
for when damon is out of my sight
no more do i sport on the plain
'till damon doth pity my pain
when phoebus was am'rous and long'd to be rude
miss daphne cry'd pish and ran swift to the wood
and rather than do such a naughty affair
she became a fine laurel to deck the god's hair
the nymph was no doubt of a cold constitution
for sure to turn tree was an odd resolution
yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse
for she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows
my lord of killala i find to my sorrow
i can't have the honour i hop'd for tomorrow
but why i'm so wretched my friend must rehearse
for i never can write my vexations in verse
disappointments are sent to poor mortals to show
'tis in vain to expect to be happy below
yet you've a fair prospect it must be confess'd
who with fortune and station and delia are bless'd
with delia whose soul is so fitted for you
who shares with such pleasure the good which you do
who visits your see with far other designs
than conning your rentrolls and raising your fines
no longer let rome her old argument boast
that by marriage the end of the priesthood is lost
that toil'd and entangled in family cares
the clergy forget their celestial affairs
for had she known delia she must have confess'd
that the church in the marriage of prelates was bless'd
and auld robin forbes hes gien tem a dance
i pat on my speckets to see them aw prance
i thout o' the days when i was but fifteen
and skipp'd wi' the best upon forbes's green
of aw things that is i think thout is meast queer
it brings that that's bypast and sets it down here
i see willy as plain as i dui this bit leace
when he tuik his cwoat lappet and deeghted his feace
the lasses aw wonder'd what willy cud see
in yen that was dark and hard featur'd leyke me
and they wonder'd ay mair when they talk'd o' my wit
and slily telt willy that cudn't be it
but willy he laugh'd and he meade me his weyfe
and whea was mair happy thro' aw his lang leyfe
it's e'en my great comfort now willy is geane
that he offen said nea pleace was leyke his awn heame
i mind when i carried my wark to yon steyle
where willy was deykin the time to beguile
he wad fling me a daisy to put i' my breast
and i hammer'd my noddle to mek out a jest
but merry or grave willy often wad tell
there was nin o' the leave that was leyke my awn sel
and he spak what he thout for i'd hardly a plack
when we married and nobbet ae gown to my back
when the clock had struck eight i expected him heame
and wheyles went to meet him as far as dumleane
of aw hours it telt eight was dearest to me
but now when it streykes there's a tear i' my ee
o willy dear willy it never can be
that age time or death can divide thee and me
for that spot on earth that's aye dearest to me
is the turf that has cover'd my willy frae me
by the lyre of apollo the locks of the muses
and the pure lucid stream aganippe produces
my ellis i love thee then pay me in kind
let the thought of a friend never slip from your mind
so may fancy and judgment together combine
and the bosom be fill'd with an ardor divine
that thy brows may the laurel with justice still claim
and the temple of liberty mount thee to fame
if it e'er can give pleasure to know my career
when proud london i left with intentions so queer
accept it in verse on the very first day
when the queen of warm passions precedes the fair may
when so custom prescribes and to follow old rules
one half of mankind makes the other half fools
from the town i first breath'd in i sally'd in haste
thro' highgate and finchley and barnet i pass'd
at st alban's i din'd with a laughing gay crew
not complete was the set without tucker and you
where the eighth of our harries deserted his mate
and procur'd a full sentence against his old kate
our brisk company supp'd while our wine gave a spring
and tho' at the crown we ne'er thought of the king
the morrow succeeding i got from my bed
as a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread
but the gods who will never abandon a poet
as oft has been said condescended to show it
in a coach and six horses the storm i defy'd
and left by my friends thro' the tempest i ride
newportpannel receiv'd me and gave me a dinner
and a bed at northampton was press'd by a sinner
no signs of fair weather the west chester coach
at nine the next morning a welcome approach
presents fresh example i travell'd all day
at crick eat my dinner at coventry lay
i tremble whene'er i reflect on the roads
that lead to those dirty wormeaten abodes
where a woman rode naked their taxes to clear
and a taylor for peeping paid damnably dear
for two parliaments fam'd which intail a disgrace
and have left their foul manners to poison the place
next morning the fun with a face of red hue
had clear'd up th' expanse and array'd it in blue
when i left the vile town 'gainst which ever i'll rail
while meriden offers no humble regale
but near mixal park din'd at house of mean fame
and at night to the field of slain carcasses came
tho' full old are thy tow'rs yet receive my just praise
may thy ale be recorded and live in my lays
thy gothic cathedral new homage still claims
nor refuse i thy due tho' repair'd by king james
i forgot to advise you the sky being clear
'twas at coventry first i ascended my chair
but alas on the morrow how dismal the sight
for the day had assum'd all the horrors of night
the clouds their gay visage had chang'd to a frown
and in a white mantle cloath'd litchfield's old town
but at noon all was o'er when intrepid and bold
as a trainband commander or falstaff of old
and proudly defying the wind and the snow
when the danger was pass'd i determin'd to go
at stone i repos'd but at ousley i din'd
when our reck'ning was cheap and the landlord was kind
next morning we sally'd and staffordshire lost
but not ill entertain'd by a cestrian host
on the banks of the wever at namptwich renown'd
for an excellent brine pit our dinner we found
the wine was not bad tho' the ale did displease
and an unctuous desert was serv'd up of old cheese
but as time will not tarry our course we resume
and st george's dragoons take their seats in our room
so travelling onwards with pleasure we see
old caerleon so famous o'er looking the dee
four days there we rested and blithsome and gay
forgot the bad weather we met on the way
then old chester farewel till i see thee again
and can stroll thro' thy streets without dreading the rain
may thy river still swell better pleas'd with his charge
than when edgar was row'd by eight kings in his barge
be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide
and each virgin in bloom be affianc'd a bride
may the heart and the hand at the altar be join'd
and no matron complain that a husband's unkind
let their bounty to strangers refound in each song
be barnstone their copy they cannot go wrong
o'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue
and old flint in the prospect now rises to view
how strange to behold here our language is fled
to converse with these people's to talk to the dead
and a turk or chinese is as well understood
by these roisters who boast of cadwalladar's blood
as an englishman here who is certainly undone
if he thinks to make use of the language of london
from flint we depart with our landlord and guide
who show'd us that kindness which courts never try'd
the castle where richard his grandeur laid down
and betray'd his own life by surrend'ring the crown
now the well we survey where a virgin of old
to all flame but religion's was lifeless and cold
when in vain princely cradoc had offer'd his bed
the merciless heathen e'en chopp'd off her head
hence the stones are distain'd with the colour of blood
and each cripple is cur'd who will bathe in the flood
thus the rankest absurdity brain can conceive
superstition imposes and crowds will believe
turn from legends and nonsense to see a gay sight
where the meadows of clewyn the senses delight
and excuse that i aim not to point out the place
lest my numbers too lowly the landscape disgrace
at rhydland we dine and a castle we view
whose founder i'd name if the founder i knew
but our host gives the word and we hurry away
lest the length of the journey outrun the short day
now ascend penmenrose oh beware as you rise
what a prospect of horror what dreadful surprize
see that height more sublime which no footsteps e'er try'd
there the ocean roars loudly how awful his pride
how narrow the path observe where you tread
nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head
if you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom
dash'd against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb
the danger is past and now conway's broad beech
fatigu'd and dismay'd with great gladness we reach
in a leaky old boat we were wafted safe o'er
tho' two drunkards our steersmen to th' opposite shore
here the town and the river are both of a name
and boast the first edward who rais'd her to fame
there a supper was order'd which no one could touch
this too little was boil'd and that roasted too much
to his chamber full hungry each pilgrim retreats
and forgets his lost meal 'twixt a pair of welch sheets
a castle hard by i with pleasure behold
which kings had long dwelt in or giants of old
but the daw and each nightbird now builds up her nest
and with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest
we waken'd at four and our host left us here
as the worst ways were past so but small was our fear
we follow'd our route and cross'd penmenmaur'sside
where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride
still above us old rocks seem to threaten a fall
and present to spectators the form of a wall
now bangor we reach oh if e'er thou hadst fame
tho' lawn sleeves thou bestow'st on my life 'tis a shame
there we cross o'er an arm of the sea and carouse
on the opposite shore at an excellent house
thro' anglesea's island we rattle our chaise
while the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze
for be pleas'd to observe and with diligence note
that 'twas here first in wales that i met with a goat
o'er roads rough and craggy our journey we sped
nor baited again 'till we reach'd holyhead
the next day at noon in the wyndham we sail
and the packet danc'd brisk with a prosperous gale
we at ten past the bar in the wherry confin'd
which swims on no water and sails with no wind
'till near two we sate cursing in vain they may row
not a snail is so sluggish nor tortoise so slow
'till a boat took us in and at length set us down
at the quay of st george in st patrick's chief town
thence i wrote to my friend nor believe what those say
or too fond to find fault or too wantonly gay
who with taunts contumelious this island o'erload
as with bogs and with blunders and nonsense full stow'd
for believe me they live not unbless'd with good air
and their daughters are beauteous and sons debonair
here tho' bacchus too often displays his red face
yet minerva he holds in the strictest embrace
nor the maiden is coy ev'ry charm to resign
and the ivy and laurel peep forth from the vine
thus i've told you in verse the whole progress i took
as true as if sworn in full court on the book
let me know how in london you measure your time
'twill be welcome in prose but twice welcome in rhyme
tho' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find
what all must confess to be rare
a female still chearful and faithful and kind
the blessings of autumn to share
let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine
overspread with its branches and shade
whose clusters appear more transparent and fine
as its leaves are beginning to sade
when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load
in our orchard surrounded with pales
in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd
for a tart that in winter regales
when the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn
seem to hang on its surface like smoak
'till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn
within doors let us prattle and joke
but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves
and at work in the fields are all hands
some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves
let us carelesly stroll o'er the lands
how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make
to collect what kind nature has sent
heaven grant we may not of their labour partake
but oh give us their happy content
and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook
let us silently sit at our ease
and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook
struggles hard to procure its release
and now when the husbandman sings harvest home
and the corn's all got into the house
when the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come
to frolic and feast and carouse
when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed
and are leaving the branches all bare
either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead
or else blown to and fro in the air
when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem
and the axletree's ready to break
while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team
and then claps the poor jades on the neck
in the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds
or the fearful young covey beset
which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds
are becoming a prey to the net
let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords
still amus'd with these innocent sports
nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords
with their grand entertainments in courts
in the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles
deep engag'd in some amorous chat
and 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles
what they both have a mind to be at
to our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair
let our mutual endearments revive
and let no single action or look but declare
how contented and happy we live
should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul
let soft music the phantoms remove
for 'tis harmony only has force to controul
and unite all the passions in love
with her eyes but half open her cap all awry
when the lass is preparing for bed
and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by
sometimes rouzes and scratches his head
in the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark
and the labourers snore as they lie
not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark
in the farm or the village hard by
at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this
ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids
let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss
which the sunshine and daylight forbids
a female still cheerful and faithful and kind
as its leaves are beginning to fade
seem to hang on its surface like smoke
let us carelesly strole o'er the lands
hark hark 'tis a voice from the tomb
come lucy it cries come away
the grave of thy colin has room
to rest thee beside his cold clay
i come my dear shepherd i come
ye friends and companions adieu
i haste to my colin's dark home
to die on his bosom so true
all mournful the midnight bell rung
when lucy sad lucy arose
and forth to the green turf she sprung
where colin's pale ashes repose
all wet with the night's chilling dew
her bosom embrac'd the cold ground
while stormy winds over her blew
and nightravens croak'd all around
how long my lov'd colin she cry'd
how long must thy lucy complain
how long shall the grave my love hide
how long ere it join us again
for thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd
with thee o'er the world would she fly
for thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd
for thee would she lie down and die
alas what avails it how dear
thy lucy was once to her swain
her face like the lily so fair
and eyes that gave light to the plain
the shepherd that lov'd her is gone
that face and those eyes charm no more
and lucy forgot and alone
to death shall her colin deplore
while thus she lay sunk in despair
and mourn'd to the echoes around
inflam'd all at once grew the air
and thunder shook dreadful the ground
i hear the kind call and obey
o colin receive me she cried
then breathing a groan o'er his clay
she hung on his tombstone and died
ye shepherds so careless and gay
who sport with the nymphs of the plain
take heed lest you frolic away
the peace you can never regain
let not folly your bosoms annoy
and of love the dear mischief beware
you may think 'tis all sunshine and joy
i know 'its o'ershadow'd with care
love's morning how blithsome it shines
with an aspect deceitfully fair
its day oft in sorrow declines
and it sets in the night of despair
hope paints the gay scene to the sight
while fancy her visions bestows
and gilds every dream with delight
but to wake us to sensible woes
how hard is my lot to complain
of a nymph whom i yet must adore
tho' she love not her shepherd again
her damon must love her the more
for it was not the pride of her sex
that treated his vows with disdain
for it was not the pleasure to vex
that made her delude her fond swain
'twas his the fair nymph to behold
he hop'd and he rashly believ'd
'twas hers to be fatally cold
he lov'd and was fondly deceiv'd
for such is of lovers the doom
while passions their reason beguile
'tis warrant enough to presume
if they catch but a look or a smile
yet surely my phillis would seem
to prize me most shepherds above
but that might be only esteem
while i foolishly construed it love
yet others like damon believ'd
the nymph might have favour'd her swain
and others like him were deceiv'd
like him tho' they cannot complain
of phyllis was always my song
for she was my pride and my care
and the folks as we wander'd along
would call us the conjugal pair
they mark'd how i walk'd at her side
how her hand to my bosom i prest
each tender endearment i try'd
and i thought none was ever so blest
but now the delusion is o'er
these daydreams of pleasure are fled
now her damon is pleasing no more
and the hopes of her shepherd are dead
may he that my fair shall obtain
may he as thy damon be true
or haply thou'lt think of that swain
who bids thee dear maiden adieu
from lincoln to london rode forth our young squire
to bring down a wife whom the swains might admire
but in spite of whatever the mortal could say
the goddess objected the length of the way
to give up the op'ra the park and the ball
for to view the stag's horns in an old country hall
to have neither china nor india to see
nor laceman to plague in a morning not she
to relinquish the playhouse quin garrick and clive
who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive
to forego the full box for his lonesome abode
o heav'ns she should faint she should die on the road
to forget the gay fashions and gestures of france
and to leave dear auguste in the midst of the dance
and harlequin too 'twas in vain to require it
and she wonder'd how folks had the face to desire it
she might yield to resign the sweet singers of ruckholt
where the citizenmatron regales with her cuckold
but ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall
and the music the lamps and the glare of vauxhall
to be sure she could breathe no where else than in town
thus she talk'd like a wit and he look'd like a clown
but while honest harry despair'd to succeed
a coach with a coronet trail'd her to tweed
behold my amanda yon prodigal rose
flinging forth all its sweets to each zephyr that blows
while each breeze steals some odour or soft tint away
and next sun may destroy what has pleas'd us today
of beauty so lavish the too selfish eye
leaves the flow'ret tho' blooming to droop and to die
not so that sweet bud where fond nature bestows
each promise of fragrance that flaunts in the rose
with a blush seems to think she can veil every charm
and artlessly deems not those blushes can harm
while with delicate prudence it steals on the sight
and comes forth as if frighten'd of giving delight
when first in eden's roseate bow'rs
adam mark'd the lonely hours
though in life no pain he knew
yet from life few joys he drew
still the social passions slept
hope alone her vigil kept
thus in eden's hallow'd shade
sweetly sang the blueey'd maid
tenant of this happy plain
stranger blest to ev'ry pain
still imperfect is thy state
what is life without a mate
rising with the second morn
lovely woman shall be born
blest with her thy breast shall know
charms divine from love that flow
pausing here the blueey'd maid
ceas'd to sing in eden's shade
charm'd by strains so sweet so blest
the common father sunk to rest
when appear'd the second dawn
pleas'd he trod the verdant lawn
seated 'neath a woodbine's shade
soon he saw the perfect maid
each in mutual wonder gaz'd
love within each bosom blaz'd
rosy blushes tinge the fair
smiling cherubs bless the pair
each transported with their lot
join to bless the nuptial knot
to a more sequester'd shade
adam led the blushing maid
lock'd within each other's arms
gazing on each other's charms
each exchang'd a balmy kiss
giving thus a birth to bliss
shall this day unheeded fly
and like vulgar days pass by
dull as tho' i be
shall it pass unsung by me
no when i this day forget
may i share that poet's fate
singing what is daily said
rhyming what is never read
health and joy long life and peace
pray we next for poets may
sure as well as prosefolks pray
and as this day rolls around
may you still be perfect found
still in virtue's noble race
pressing for the foremost place
scorning all that's low or lewd
daring to be great and good
till your race of life is done
and the glorious meed your own
such as angels now receive
such as heav'n alone can give
come my muse prepare the lay
once more hail this happy day
bid it shine o'er all the past
brightest since it is the last
for her full meridian ray
soon must sicken and decay
see she hastens down the skies
in another sphere to rise
in a world unknown untry'd
sets a maid to rise a bride
having shone his summer's day
gilding all the groves and plains
drops at length the golden reins
and night's curtain round him spread
hides his beams in thetis 'bed
when the british warrior queen
bleeding from the roman rods
sought with an indignant mien
counsel of her country's gods
sage beneath a spreading oak
sat the druid hoary chief
ev'ry burning word he spoke
full of rage and full of grief
princess if our aged eyes
weep upon thy matchless wrongs
'tis because resentment ties
all the terrors of our tongues
rome shall perish write that word
in the blood that she has spilt
perish hopeless and abhorr'd
deep in ruin as in guilt
rome for empire far renown'd
tramples on a thousand states
soon her pride shall kiss the ground
hark the gaul is at her gates
other romans shall arise
heedless of a soldier's name
sounds not arms shall win the prize
harmony the path to fame
then the progeny that springs
from the forests of our land
arm'd with thunder clad with wings
shall a wider world command
regions caesar never knew
thy posterity shall sway
where his eagles never flew
none invincible as they
such the bards prophetic words
pregnant with celestial fire
bending as he swept the chords
of his sweet but awful lyre
she with all a monarch's pride
felt them in her bosom glow
rush'd to battle fought and died
dying hurl'd them at the foe
ruffians pittiless as proud
heav'n awards the vengeance due
empire is on us bestow'd
shame and ruin wait for you
the wars of numantia and hannibal dire
on land or on ocean the fighting
maecenas ne'er suited my peaceable lyre
in subjects much softer delighting
you love not of centaurs embattled to hear
nor of giants a tale of such wonder
who shook all the skies made jupiter fear
'till drove by alcides and thunder
in prose my good patron more nobly you write
as your topic than these is much better
how caesar with glory can govern and fight
and lead haughty kings in his fetter
alone my gay muse of licinnia would sing
the constant goodnatur'd and pretty
so graceful to dance with the maids in a ring
so sparkling so merry and witty
while you play with her hair that is carelessly curl'd
while this way now that way she twitches
of your teazing so kindly complaining no world
could bribe for one lock with its riches
thus blest with the nymph how transporting the joy
who whimsical wanton amuses
who pleasingly forward or prettily coy
oft snatches the kiss she refuses
honest william an easy and goodnatur'd fellow
wou'd a little too oft get a little too mellow
body coachman was he to an eminent brewer
no better e'er sat in a box to be sure
his coach was kept clean and no mothers or nurses
took that care of their babes that he took of his horses
he had these ay and fifty good qualities more
but the business of tipling cou'd ne'er be got o'er
so his master effectually mended the matter
by hiring a man who drank nothing but water
now william says he you see the plain case
had you drunk as he does you'd kept a good place
drink water quoth william had all men done so
you'd never have wanted a coachman i trow
they're soakers like me whom you load with reproaches
that enable you brewers to ride in your coaches
when sly jemmy twitcher had smugged up his face
with a lick of court whitewash and pious grimace
awooing he went where three sisters of old
in harmless society guttle and scold
'lord sister' says physic to law 'i declare
such a sheepbiting look such a pickpocket air
not i for the indies you know i'm no prude
but his nose is a shame and his eyes are so lewd
then he shambles and straddles so oddly i fear
no at our time of life 'twould be silly my dear'
'i don't know' says law 'now methinks for his look
'tis just like the picture in rochester's book
but his character phyzzy his morals his life
when she died i can't tell but he once had a wife
'they say he's no christian loves drinking and whoring
and all the town rings of his swearing and roaring
his lying and filching and newgatebird tricks
not i for a coronet chariot and six'
divinity heard between waking and dozing
her sisters denying and jemmy proposing
from dinner she rose with her bumper in hand
she stroked up her belly and stroked down her band
'what a pother is here about wenching and roaring
why david loved catches and solomon whoring
did not israel filch from the egyptians of old
their jewels of silver and jewels of gold
the prophet of bethel we read told a lie
he drinks so did noah he swears so do i
to refuse him for such peccadillos were odd
besides he repents and he talks about god
'never hang down your head you poor penitent elf
come buss me i'll be mrs twitcher myself
damn ye both for a couple of puritan bitches
he's christian enough that repents and that stitches'
have ye seen the tusky boar
or the bull with sullen roar
on surrounding foes advance
so caradoc bore his lance
if a perfect form can please
join'd with innocence and ease
wit and eloquence refin'd
harmony and judgment join'd
meek and gentle to excess
neat and elegant in dress
charitable free and gay
blooming as the month of may
foe to art and vanity
from deceit and folly free
learned as a female ought
not by idle custom taught
grace in all her steps doth move
beauteous as the queen of love
if such charms can please the sight
where all elegance unite
virtue and fair truth divine
the laurel juliet be thine
look round the wide world each profession you'll find
hath something dishonest which myst'ry they call
each knave points another at home is stark blind
except but his own there's a cheat in them all
when tax'd with imposture the charge he'll evade
and like falstaff pretend he but lives by his trade
the hero ambitious like philip's great son
who wept when he found no more mischief to do
ne'er scruples a neighbouring realm to o'errun
while slaughters and carnage his sabre imbrue
of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade
for conquest is glorious and fighting his trade
the statesman who steers by wise machiavel's rules
is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face
they're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools
and breach of his promise he counts no disgrace
but policy calls it reproach to evade
for flatt'ry's his province cajoling his trade
the priest will instruct you this world to despise
with all its vain pomp for a kingdom on high
while earthly preferments are chiefly his prize
and all his pursuits give his doctrine the lye
he'll plead you the gospel your charge to evade
the lab'rer's entititled to live by his trade
the lawyer as oft on the wrong side as right
who tortures for fee the true sense of the laws
while black he by sophistry proves to be white
and falshood and perjury lists in his cause
with steady assurance all crime will evade
his client's his care and he follows his trade
the sons of machaon who thirsty for gold
the patient past cure visit thrice in a day
write largely the pharmacop league to uphold
while poverty's left to diseases a prey
are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade
their practice is great and they shine in their trade
since then in all stations imposture is found
no one of another can justly complain
the coin he receives will pass current around
and where he is cousen'd he cousens again
but i who for cheats this apology made
cheat myself by my rhyming and starve by my trade
when war had broke in on the peace of auld men
and frae chelsea to arms they were summon'd again
twa vet'rans grown gray wi' their muskets sair soil'd
wi' a sigh were relating how hard they had toil'd
the drum it was beating to fight they incline
but aye they look back to the days o' langsyne
oh davy man weel thou remembers the time
when twa brisk young callans and baith i' our prime
the duke bade us conquer and show'd us the way
and mony a braw chiel we laid low on that day
yet i'd venture fu' cheerfu' this auld trunk o' mine
could william but lead and i fight as langsyne
but garrison duty is a' we can do
tho' our arms are worn weak yet our hearts are still true
we carena for dangers by land or by sea
for time is turn'd coward and no thee and me
and tho' at the change we should sadly repine
youth winna return nor the strength o' langsyne
when after our conquests it joys me to mind
how thy janet caress'd thee and my meg was kind
they follow'd our fortunes tho' never so hard
and we cared na for plunder wi' sic a reward
e'en now they're resolv'd baith their hames to resign
and will follow us yet for the sake o' langsyne
as chloe on flowers reclin'd o'er the stream
she sigh'd to the breeze and made colin her theme
tho' pleasant the stream and tho' cooling the breeze
and the flowers tho' fragrant she panted for ease
the stream it was fickle and hasted away
it kiss'd the sweet banks but no longer cou'd stay
tho' beauteous inconstant and faithless tho' fair
ah colin look in and behold thyself there
the breeze that so sweet on its bosom did play
now rose to a tempest and darken'd the day
as sweet as the breeze and as loud as the wind
such colin when angry and colin when kind
the flowers when gather'd so beauteous and sweet
now fade on her bosom and die at her feet
so fair in their bloom and so foul in decay
such colin when present and colin away
in rage and despair from the ground she arose
and from her the flowers so faded she throws
she weeps in the stream and she sighs to the wind
and resolves to drive colin quite out of her mind
but what her resolves when her colin appear'd
the stream it stood still and no tempest was hear'd
the flowers recover'd their beautiful hue
she found he was kind and believ'd he was true
come mortals enliven the hour that is lent
the ills that hang o'er us what sighs can prevent
though we see from afar as he travels life's road
soon or late we all know he must sweep our abode
in the span that's allotted then crowd every joy
though wine to true pleasure is oft an alloy
disguis'd are our pleasures as well as our woes
with the tint of the mind every circumstance glows
conan's name my lay rehearse
build to him the lofty verse
sacred tribute of the bard
verse the hero's sole reward
as the flame's devouring force
as the whirlwind in its course
as the thunder's fiery stroke
glancing on the shivered oak
did the sword of conan mow
the crimson harvest of the foe
'tis time to conclude for i make it a rule
to leave off all writing when con comes from school
he dislikes what i've written and says i had better
to send what he calls a poetical letter
to this i reply'd you are out of your wits
a letter in verse would put him in fits
he thinks it a crime in a woman to read
then what would he say should your counsel succeed
i pity poor barber his wife's so romantick
a letter in rhyme why the woman is frantick
this reading the poets has quite turn'd her head
on my life she should have a dark room and straw bed
i often heard say that st patrick took care
no poisonous creature should live in this air
he only regarded the body i find
but plato consider'd who poison'd the mind
would they'd follow his precepts who sit at the helm
and drive poetasters from out of the realm
her husband has surely a terrible life
there's nothing i dread like a versewriting wife
defend me ye powers from that fatal curse
which must heighten the plagues of for better for worse
may i have a wife that will dust her own floor
and not the fine minx recommended by more
that he was a dotard is granted i hope
who dy'd for asserting the rights of the pope
if ever i marry i'll chuse me a spouse
that shall serve and obey as she's bound by her vows
that shall when i'm dressing attend like a valet
then go to the kitchen and study my palate
she has wisdom enough that keeps out of the dirt
and can make a good pudding and cut out a shirt
what good's in a dame that will pore on a book
no give me the wife that shall save me a cook
thus far i had written then turn'd to my son
to give him advice ere my letter was done
my son should you marry look out for a wife
that's fitted to lighten the labours of life
be sure wed a woman you thoroughly know
and shun above all things a housewifely shrew
that would fly to your study with fire in her looks
and ask what you got by your poring on books
think dressing of dinner the height of all science
and to peace and good humour bid open defiance
avoid the fine lady whose beauty's her care
who sets a high price on her shape and her air
who in dress and in visits employs the whole day
and longs for the ev'ning to sit down to play
chuse a woman of wisdom as well as good breeding
with a turn at least no aversion to reading
in the care of her person exact and refin'd
yet still let her principal care be her mind
who can when her family cares give her leisure
without the dear cards pass an ev'ning with pleasure
in forming her children to virtue and knowledge
nor trust for that care to a school or a college
by learning made humble not thence taking airs
to despise or neglect her domestick affairs
nor think her less fitted for doing her duty
by knowing its reasons its use and its beauty
when you gain her affection take care to preserve it
lest others persuade her you do not deserve it
still study to heighten the joys of her life
nor treat her the worse for her being your wife
if in judgment she errs set her right without pride
'tis the province of insolent fools to deride
a husband's first praise is a friend and protector
then change not these titles for tyrant and hector
let your person be neat unaffectedly clean
tho' alone with your wife the whole day you remain
chuse books for her study to fashion her mind
to emulate those who excell'd of her kind
be religion the principal care of your life
as you hope to be blest in your children and wife
so you in your marriage shall gain its true end
and find in your wife a companion and friend
o'er moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare
as wilder'd and weary'd i roam
a gentle young shepherdess sees my despair
and leads me o'er lawns to her home
yellow sheafs from rich ceres her cottage had crown'd
green rushes were strew'd on her floor
her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round
and deck'd the sod seats at her door
we sate ourselves down to a cooling repast
fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best
while thrown from my guard by some glances she cast
love slily stole into my breast
i told my soft wishes she sweetly reply'd
ye virgins her voice was divine
i've rich ones rejected and great ones deny'd
but take me fond shepherd i'm thine
her air was so modest her aspect so meek
so simple yet sweet were her charms
i kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek
and lock'd the lov'd maid in my arms
now jocund together we tend a few sheep
and if by yon prattler the stream
reclin'd on her bosom i sink into sleep
her image still softens my dream
together we range o'er the slow rising hills
delighted with pastoral views
or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils
and point out new themes for my muse
to pomp or proud titles she ne'er did aspire
the damsel's of humble descent
the cottager peace is well known for her sire
and shepherds have nam'd her content
come shepherds we'll follow the hearse
we'll see our lov'd corydon laid
tho' sorrow may blemish the verse
yet let a sad tribute be paid
they call'd him the pride of the plain
in sooth he was gentle and kind
he mark'd on his elegant strain
the graces that glow'd in his mind
on purpose he planted yon trees
that birds in the covert might dwell
he cultur'd his thyme for the bees
but never wou'd rifle their cell
ye lambkins that play'd at his feet
go bleat and your master bemoan
his music was artless and sweet
his manners as mild as your own
no verdure shall cover the vale
no bloom on the blossoms appear
the sweets of the forest shall fail
and winter discolour the year
no birds in our hedges shall sing
our hedges so vocal before
since he that should welcome the spring
can greet the gay season no more
his phillis was fond of his praise
and poets came round in a throng
they listen'd they envy'd his lays
but which of them equal'd his song
ye shepherds henceforward be mute
for lost is the pastoral strain
so give me my corydon's flute
and thus let me break it in twain
cupid ere depriv'd of sight
young and apt for all delight
met with folly on the way
as idle and as fond of play
in gay sports the time they pass
now run now wrestle on the grass
their painted wings then nimbly ply
and ev'ry way for mast'ry try
'till a contest do's arise
who has won th' appointed prize
gentle love refers the case
to the next that comes in place
trusting to his flatt'ring wiles
and softens the dispute with smiles
but folly who no temper knows
words pursues with hotter blows
'till the eyes of love were lost
which has such pain to mortals cost
venus hears his mournful crys
and repeats 'em in the skys
to jupiter in council set
with peers for the occasion met
in her arms the boy she bears
bathing him in falling tears
and whilst his want of eyes is shown
secures the judges by her own
folly to the board must come
and hear the tryal and the doom
which cytherea loudly prays
may be as heavy as the case
which when all was justly weigh'd
cupid's wings now useless made
that a staff his feet must guide
which wou'd still be apt to slide
this decree at last was read
that love by folly shou'd be lead
in the barn the tenant cock
close to partlet perch'd on high
briskly crows the shepherd's clock
jocund that the morning's nigh
swiftly from the mountain's brow
shadows nurs'd by night retire
and the peeping sunbeam now
paints with gold the village spire
philomel forsakes the thorn
plaintive where she prates at night
and the lark to meet the morn
so ars beyond the shepherd's sight
from the lowroof'd cottage ridge
see the chatt'ring swallow spring
darting through the onearch'd bridge
quick she dips her dappled wing
now the pinetree's waving top
gently greets the morning gale
kidlings now begin to crop
daisies on the dewy dale
from the balmy sweets uncloy'd
restless till her task be done
now the busy bee's employ'd
sipping dew before the sun
trickling through the crevic'd rock
where the limpid stream distils
sweet refreshment waits the flock
when 'tis sundrove from the hills
colin's for the promis'd corn
ere the harvest hopes are ripe
anxious whilst the huntsman's horn
boldly sounding drowns his pipe
sweet o sweet warbling throng
on the white emblossom'd spray
nature's universal song
echos to the rising day
fervid on the glitt'ring flood
now the noontide radiance glows
drooping o'er its infant bud
not a dewdrop's left the rose
by the brook the shepherd dines
from the fierce meridian heat
shelter'd by the branching pines
pendant o'er his grassy seat
now the flock forsakes the glade
where uncheck'd the sunbeams fall
sure to find a pleasing shade
by the ivy'd abbey wall
echo in her airy round
o'er the river rock and hill
cannot catch a single sound
save the clack of yonder mill
cattle court the zephyrs bland
where the streamlet wanders cool
or with languid silence stand
midway in the marshy pool
but from mountain dell or stream
not a flutt'ring zephyr springs
fearful lest the noontide beam
scorch its soft its silken wings
not a leaf has leave to stir
nature's lull'd serene and still
quiet e'en the shepherd's cur
sleeping on the heathclad hill
languid is the landscape round
till the fresh descending shower
grateful to the thirsty ground
raises ev'ry fainting flower
now the hill the hedge is green
now the warblers' throats in tune
blithsome is the verdant scene
brighten'd by the beams of noon
o'er the heath the heifer strays
free the surrow'd task is done
now the village windows blaze
burnish'd by the setting sun
now he sets behind the hill
sinking from a golden sky
can the pencil's mimic skill
copy the refulgent dye
trudging as the plowmen go
to the smoaking hamlet bound
giantlike their shadows grow
lengthen'd o'er the level ground
where the rising forest spreads
shelter for the lordly dome
to their high built airy beds
see the rooks returning home
as the lark with vary'd tune
carols to the evening loud
mark the mild resplendent moon
breaking through a parted cloud
now the hermit howlet peeps
from the barn or twisted brake
and the blue mist slowly creeps
curling on the silver lake
as the trout in speckled pride
playful from its bosom springs
to the banks a ruffled tide
verges im successive rings
tripping through the silken grass
o'er the pathdivided dale
mark the rosecomplexion'd lass
with her wellpois'd milken pail
linnets with unnumber'd notes
and the cuckow bird with two
tuning sweet their mellow throats
bid the setting sun adieu
dear nancy since men have all made their own laws
which oppress the poor women whatever's the cause
since by hardness of reason or hardness of fist
all wrong must be right if they choose to persist
i'd have you with caution in wedlock engage
for if once you are caught you're a bird in a cage
that may for dear liberty flutter the wing
as you hop round the perch but 'tis chance if you sing
the man who in courtship is studious to please
throws off his attention and hears not nor sees
whilst her who before was the fairest of flowers
the cloud on his brow ever drenches with showers
and the man whose rough manners were courteous before
gives you every reason to look for no more
for such churls i've seen through the whole of their lives
give nought but an oath or a frown to their wives
let her speech or her manners be e'er so bewitching
why women should only give mouth in the kitchen
nor e'en there rule the roast for my lord must be by
and a finger must always have in every pie
then he'd lifeless become to such silence is prone
that you'd think him a statue just cut out of stone
and his fair one i'll wager not all the year round
hears aught of his voice save a humandha sound
now some to advise you all evils to shun
bid you ever be happy by holding your tongue
but jack boaster has taught me that this will not do
for when he is railing his dear shall rail too
and andrew macgrumble insists that his wife
shall ask pardon most humbly each hour of her life
and he's right for since wedlock has made them both one
'tis fit for such sin she should daily atone
then there's trim little dicky who calls himself bless'd
in a spouse so accomplish'd so young and well dress'd
should she play with her lapdog 'twould give him such pain
he would tear down a curl and then curl it again
should you travel life's road with a mate such as these
'tis a chance the whole journey you'd do aught to please
yet you fondly fancy that yours is a swain
whom softness and sweetness will still keep the same
that when years have roll'd on though your locks be turn'd grey
though the rosebud is blown nay quite faded away
tho' the canker of time should love's blossoms destroy
yet as darby and joan you may still be wish'd joy
then hold your good humour for that is the charm
which can make beauty linger and keep the heart warm
and when youth with light wings shall for ever have flown
make your darby delighted to sit by his joan
had i but the torrent's might
with headlong rage and wild affright
upon dera's squadrons hurled
to rush and sweep them from the world
too too secure in youthful pride
by them my friend my hol died
great cian's son of madoc old
he asked no heaps of hoarded gold
alone in nature's wealth arrayed
he asked and had the lovely maid
to cattraeth's vale in glittering row
twice two hundred warriors go
every warrior's manly neck
chains of regal honour deck
wreathed in many a golden link
from the golden cup they drink
nectar that the bees produce
or the grape's ecstatic juice
flushed with mirth and hope they burn
but none from cattraeth's vale return
save aeron brave and conan strong
bursting through the bloody throng
and i the meanest of them all
that live to weep and sing their fall
cease chlorinda cease to chide me
when my passion i relate
why shou'd kindness be denied me
why shou'd love be pay'd with hate
if the fruit of all my wishes
must be to be treated so
what cou'd you do more than this is
to your most outrageous foe
simple strephon cease complaining
talk no more of foolish love
think not e'er my heart to reign in
think not all you say can move
did i take delight to fetter
thrice ten thousand slaves a day
thrice ten thousand times your betters
gladly would my rule obey
strive not fairest to unbind me
let me keep my pleasing chain
charms that first to love inclin'd me
will for ever love maintain
wou'd you send my heart a roving
first to love i must forbear
wou'd you have me cease from loving
you must cease from being fair
strephon leave to talk thus idly
let me hear of love no more
you mistake chlorinda widely
thus to teize her o'er and o'er
seek not her who still forbids you
to some other tell your moan
chuse where'er your fancy leads you
let chlorinda but alone
if chlorinda still denies me
that which none but she can give
let the whole wide world despise me
'tis for her alone i live
grant me yet this one poor favour
with this one request comply
let us each go on for ever
i to ask and you deny
since my strephon you so kind are
all pretensions to resign
trust chlorinda you may find her
less severe than you divine
strephon struck with joy beholds her
wou'd have spoke but knew not how
but he look'd such things as told her
more than all his speech cou'd do
of all my experience how vast the amount
since fifteen long winters i fairly can count
was ever a damsel so sadly betray'd
to live to these years and yet still be a maid
ye heroes triumphant by land and by sea
sworn vott'ries to love but undmindful of me
you can strom a strong fort or can form a blockade
yet ye stand by like dastards and see me a maid
ye lawyers so just who with slippery tongue
can do what you please or with right or with wrong
can it be or by law or by equity said
that a buxom young girl ought to die an old maid
ye learned physicians whose excellent skill
can save or demolish can cure or can kill
to a poor forlorn damsel contribute your aid
who is sick very sick of remaining a maid
ye fops i invoke not to list to my song
who answer no end and to no sex belong
ye echoes of echoes and shadows of shade
for if i had you i might still be a maid
a jolly brave toper who cou'd not forbear
tho' his life was in danger old port and stale beer
gave the doctors the hearing but still wou'd drink on
till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton
the more he took physic the worse still he grew
and tapping was now the last thing he cou'd do
affairs at this crisis and doctors come down
he began to consider so sent for his son
tom see by what courses i've shorten'd my life
i'm leaving the world ere i'm forty and five
more than probable 'tis that in twentyfour hours
this manor this house and estate will be yours
my early excesses may teach you this truth
that 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth
says tom who's a lad of a generous spirit
and not like young rakes who 're in haste to inherit
sir don't be dishearten'd altho' it be true
th' operation is painful and hazardous too
'tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'
and then as for years you may yet be call'd young
your life after this may be happy and long
don't flatter me tom was the father's reply
with a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye
too well by experience my vessels thou know'st
no sooner are tap'd but they give up the ghost
lov'd companions let us sing
wake the dear according string
come with gladness fill the dome
pour the happy song of home
now sweet home our steps are free
now sweet home we fly to thee
let the vaulted roofs resound
sacred home with blessings crown'd
learning thorny are thy ways
thought is weary of the maze
let us seek awhile the goal
where affection rests her soul
now o toiling muse repose
muse the classic volume close
bid the cares of study cease
give the vacant hours to peace
joyful with the smiling year
we will smile for home is near
strangers will our song repeat
strangers feel that home is sweet
bring o bring th' impatient steed
let us to the threshold speed
where we shed the tear of bliss
where we meet a mother's kiss
home of childhood swell the strain
while we hail thy gates again
why aurora thus delay
slothful goddess give the day
many are the mournful stories
many are the piercing sorrows
love that jewel of our nature
but 'tis merit makes the purchase
'tis not wealth nor sordid riches
no 'tis surely sweet contentment
think not parents that your children
or your influence bind their natures
fifty years have render'd callous
but let memory be recorder
if at twenty hearts were harden'd
what would be their rigid natures
once within this happy island
birth and wealth and growing greatness
pride had mix'd with every honour
nor did there e'er one soft emotion
yet the wise and gracious donor
and to lead his soul to mercy
youth conjoin'd with all the graces
and in every beauteous feature
flora as she cross'd her garden
and when passing sweet alicia
form'd by virtue and by nature
many a youth with noble fervour
merit only caught the maiden
edwin durst not hope for favour
birth nor riches gild his title
yet she thinks that fair escutcheon
but alas the world's opinion
nor alicia will thy father
long was seen the lovely maiden
smiles forsook their former mansion
this the angry father told her
to her child blanch'd with emotion
ah my love have you deceiv'd me
sure thou knowest i'd die to save thee
yes too well i know your goodness
and when forc'd to pierce that bosom
your inquiring looks have ask'd me
and your nice discernment told you
often have you seen my sorrow
edwin but i need not tell you
the gallant ship her wings unfurls
edwin from his lov'd retreats
'tis not change of place nor climate
neither is the power of absence
edwin found this truth and drooping
sultry suns seem'd in conjunction
sad despair and cruel absence
and upon his funeral bier
equal grief by slower movements
deep disease by secret workings
absence all her comforts wasted
though each day her glowing fancy
o'er her father's rigid nature
live alicia live my daughter
my pride and hate i've now discarded
soon soon may propitious breezes
joy illum'd its former mansion
hope shone forth in rays of gladness
but ah how short our gleams of pleasure
joys like arrows swiftly flying
alicia heard her edwin's story
every look declar'd her dying
soon her wishes were accomplish'd
and her parents mourn'd heartbroken
yearly shall the village maidens
and as they list her simple story
peace where art thou to be found
where in all the spacious round
may thy footsteps be pursu'd
where may thy calm seats be view'd
on some mountain dost thou lie
screnely near the ambient sky
smiling at the clouds below
where rough storms and tempests grow
or in some retired plain
undisturb'd dost thou remain
where no angry whirlwinds pass
where no floods oppress the grass
high above or deep below
fain i thy retreat wou'd know
fain i thee alone wou'd find
balm to my o'erweary'd mind
since what here the world enjoys
or our passions most employs
peace opposes or destroys
pleasure's a tumultuous thing
busy still and still on wing
flying swift from place to place
darting from each beauteous face
from each strongly mingled bowl
through th' inflam'd and restless soul
sov'reign pow'r who fondly craves
but himself to pomp enslaves
stands the envy of mankind
peace in vain attempts to find
thirst of wealth no quiet knows
but near the deathbed siercer grows
wounding men with secret stings
for evils it on others brings
war who not discreetly shuns
thorough life the gauntlet runs
swords and pikes and waves and flames
each their stroke against him aims
love if such a thing there be
is all despair or extasie
poetry's the feav'rish fit
th' o'erslowing of unbounded wit c
swift for the antients has argu'd so well
'tis apparent from thence that the moderns excel
tho' cheerful discreet and with freedom well bred
she never repented an idle word said
securely she smiles on the forward and bold
they feel what they owe her and feel it untold
lovely shines thy wedded fair
gentle as the yielding air
cheering as the solar beam
soothing as the fountainstream
why then jealous husband rail
all may breathe the ambient gale
bask in heaven's diffusive ray
drink the streams that pass away
all may share unless'ning joy
why then jealous peevish boy
water air and light confine
ere thou think'st her only thine
ever busy'd ne'er employ'd
ever loving ne'er enjoy'd
ever doom'd to seek and miss
and pay unbless'd the price of bliss
have my friends in the town in the gay busy town
forgot such a man as john dyer
or heedless despise they or pity the clown
whose bosom no pageantries fire
no matter no matter content in the shades
contented why every thing charms me
fall in tunes all adown the green steep ye cascades
till hence rigid virtue alarms me
till outrage arises or misery needs
the swift the intrepid avenger
till sacred religion or liberty bleeds
then mine be the deed and the danger
alas what a folly that wealth and domain
we heap up in sin and in sorrow
immense is the toil yet the labour how vain
is not life to be over tomorrow
then glide on my moments the few that i have
smoothshaded and quiet and even
while gently the body descends to the grave
and the spirit arises to heaven
pollio would'st thou condescend
here to see thy humble friend
far from doctors potions pills
drinking health on native hills
thou the precious draught may'st share
lucy shall the bowl prepare
from the brousing goat it flows
from each balmy shrub that grows
hence the kidling's wanton fire
hence the nerves that brace his fire
vigorous buxom young and gay
thou like them shalt love and play
what tho' far from silver thames
stately piles and courtly dames
here we boast a purer flood
joys that stream from sprightly blood
here is simple beauty seen
fair and cloath'd like beauty's queen
nature's hands the garbs compose
from the lilly and the rose
or if charm'd with richer dies
fancy every robe supplies
shou'd perchance some highborn fair
absent claim thy tender care
here enraptur'd shalt thou trace
s's shape and r's face
while the waking dream shall pay
many a wishing hopeless day
domes with gold and toil unbought
rise by magick pow'r of thought
where by artist's hand undrawn
slopes the vale and spreads the lawn
as if sportive nature meant
here to mock the works of kent
come and with thee bring along
jocund tale and witty song
sense to teach and words to move
arts that please adorn improve
and to gild the glorious scene
conscience spotless and serene
poor with all a ht's store
lives the man who pines for more
wretched he who doom'd to roam
never can be blest at home
nor retire within his mind
from th' ungrateful and unkind
happy they whom crowds befriend
curs'd who on the crowd depend
on the great one's peevish fit
on the coxcomb's spurious wit
ever sentenc'd to bemoan
others failings in their own
if like them rejecting ease
hills and health no longer please
quick descend thou may'st resort
to the viceroy's splendid court
there indignant shalt thou see
cringing slaves who might be free
brib'd with titles hope or gain
tye their country's shameful chain
or inspir'd by heav'n's good cause
waste the land with holy laws
while the gleanings of their power
lawyers lordlings priests devour
now methinks i hear thee say
drink alone thy mountainwhey
wherefore tempt the irish shoals
sights like these are nearer paul's
since the road of life's so ill
i to pass it use this skill
my frail carriage driving home
to its latest stage the tomb
justice first in harness strong
marches stedfastly along
charity to smooth the pace
fills the next adjoining trace
independance leads the way
whom no heavy curb do's sway
truth an equal part sustains
all indulg'd the loosen'd reins
in the box sits vig'rous health
shunning miry paths of wealth
gaiety with easy smiles
ev'ry harsher step beguiles
whilst of nature or of fate
only this i wou'd intreat
the equipage might not decay
till the worn carriage drops away
evening now from purple wings
sheds the grateful gifts she brings
brilliant drops bedeck the mead
cooling breezes shake the reed
shake the reed and curl the stream
silver'd o'er with cynthia's beam
near the checquer'd lonely grove
hears and keeps thy secrets love
stella thither let us stray i
lightly o'er the dewy way
phoebus drives his burning car
hence my lovely stella far
in his stead the queen of night
round us pours a lambent light
light that serves but just to shew
breasts that beat and cheeks that glow
let us now in whisper'd joy
evening's silent hours employ
silence best and conscious shades
please the hearts that love invades
other pleasures give them pain
lovers all but love disdain
phoebus now with fainter fire
gilds the hamlet's pointed spire
dews descending bless the soil
eve suspends the peasant's toil
o'er the panzychequer'd plains
whistling tread the jocund swains
marking now with glist'ning eyes
smoak ascending from the skies
token of the housewife's care
earnest of their simple fare
pleas'd the toils of day are o'er
rich without the miser's store
blest with love and rosy health
anxious for no other wealth
careless of the coming day
each pursues his homeward way
in no borrow'd charms array'd
mark the lovely milkingmaid
poising well the foaming pail
trip along the pasture dale
to direct her truelove's way
loud she tunes her chearful lay
he descending from the hill
meets her by the clacking mill
homeward as they drive the cows
he repeats his artless vows
as the church they loit'ring pass
rosy blushes tinge the lass
if the theme the swain pursues
soon the priest shall have his dues
rustling from the noisy school
heedless of the ferril's rule
heirs to nature's purest joys
mark the happy village boys
foes declar'd to rest and peace
o'er the green pursue the geese
summon'd by their cackling cries
to the spot the housewife hies
arm'd with distaff 'stead of steel
soon the foe her distaff feel
quickly scar'd the truants fly
homewards now in haste they hie
guardians of the village wealth
foes declar'd to fraud and stealth
tenants of the chearful hearth
frequent cause of harmless mirth
welcome to their master's board
partners of his scanty hoard
see before the wicket gate
curs parade in mimic state
heedless of the proffer'd bone
eager still to guard their own
each his faithful service pays
and with threat'ning aspect bays
waken'd by the various note
echo quits her cave remote
wandering o'er the dewy plain
warbles still the varied strain
mark the village murmurs cease
night appears with balmy peace
each extend their silent reign
o'er the peaceful village plain
lovelorn maidens dream of bliss
sleeping yield the balmy kiss
coy no more with rapture crown
those on whom they us'd to frown
prudence leagu'd with subtle art
sways no more the yielding heart
fancy now with visions bless'd
crown's the cotter's peaceful rest
happy thrice the harmless swain
tenant of the peaceful plain
far from business noise and strife
blest with every sweet of life
far from all the toil of state
all oppressions of the great
dancing blythe his nymph he leads
o'er the carpet of the meads
while his neighbour's pipe or horn
lulls the night or cheers the morn
healthy joy from labour springs
healthy joy the wish of kings
here providence in bounty flows
and joys on every sense bestows
here earth affords her kind increase
with virtue gain'd enjoy'd in peace
the harvest rich the fruitage fair
repay the cultivator's care
hills where sportive lambkins stray
flocks that fleecy tribute pay
crystal streams whose murmuring rills
stray between the flowery hills
meeting from a hundred dells
till the foaming river swells
swells beyond restraint and laves
happy lands with welcome waves
while the crystal of the floods
mocks the waving of the woods
here flowers in sweet confusion strown
o'er the verdant mead are blown
narcissus near the rivers fair
smiles at itself reflected there
sad emblem of that lover's pride
who for himself too fondly died
the crowfoot here with golden hue
the cowslips sweet the violets blue
the blushing pinks and lilies pale
like virgins fair like virgins frail
soft daffodils of early bloom
and daisies earful of the gloom
but ah those beauties soon must fall
the ruthless scythe which levels all
must sweep their harmless sweets away
and give their colours to decay
here lofty groves invade the sky
and all the tempest's rage defy
the solid oak that awes the main
the spreading elm of coarser grain
the elastic eugh whose distant wound
with england's rivals heap'd the ground
the stubborn holly rough and bold
that spreads her verdure to the cold
and boasts her berries fair and ripe
beneath december's icy gripe
all all destruction's power shall feel
and fall before the fatal steel
see this ye fair ye wise ye brave
and sink together in the grave
the squirrel climbs the nuttree bough
and strips the clusters as they grow
the little mouse with humbler hope
tastes nature's bounties as they drop
see all the feather'd warblers sing
to welcome the returning spring
the blackbird linnet finch and thrush
pour out their songs from every bush
the tuneful lark whose towering flight
fatigues the disappointed sight
these little songsters mounted high
harmonious carrol to the sky
to heaven their tuneful offering pay
and seem to hail the newborn day
sweet bird instructed by thy lays
can man forget his maker's praise
reviving from the shades of night
can he behold the allquickening light
can he unclose his fluggish eyes
nor send one rapture to the skies
at eve in softly mournful strains
the lovelorn nightingale complains
while as it strains its little throat
pleas'd echo dwells on every note
and sighs to hear the plaintive moan
and grief expressive of her own
how blest my soul how blest are those
who pass a life in such repose
who still in rural shades abide
where all their hours thus smoothly glide
whose humble aims no higher tend
than to enjoy a book and friend
whom anxious projects ne'er molest
nor war nor love disturb their rest
who form no wish of rising higher
but learn betimes to check desire
whose happy and yet humble state
provokes no threatening frowns of fate
so humble shrubs in safety grow
when storms the lofty pine o'erthrow
o hear ye powers a suppliant's voice
indulge my wish approve my choice
o grant me wheresoe'er ye please
a life of privacy and ease
no more those pleasures to pursue
which fancy paints to folly's view
nor falsly fond nor idly gay
to waste the fashionable day
no more with craving heart to go
from toy to toy from show to show
all day to counterfeit delight
and long to end the cheat for night
afford me pleasures more serene
give me to range the sylvan scene
where ceres' fullear'd sheaves abound
and flora paints th' enamel'd ground
to feel from every pressure free
the joys of truth and poetry
let contemplation string my lyre
and zeal supply poetic fire
then let me nature's wonders sing
and praise the power of nature's king
while as by chance i turn my sight
new objects strike with new delight
till fresh ideas hourly spring
and urge imagination's wing
here knowledge quicken'd by delight
shall rouse the soul to vigorous flight
rapt with the thought methinks i rise
to meditate my kindred skies
at once the past and present view
compare the former with the new
survey the world from pole to pole
join clime to clime and grasp the whole
to each effect the cause conjoin
and trace the original divine
awaken'd hope directs my way
thro' all the spacious realms of day
views the resplendent courts above
blest mansion of seraphic love
refulgent throne of power divine
where calm celestial splendors shine
whence beams of emanating light
from nature chase retiring night
quick to my breast new beauties rise
i pant to range my native skies
but here encumber'd with her clay
my soul must wait the final day
and now but short excursions make
and joys thro' long perspectives take
such joys as virtuous souls improve
and heighten wonder into love
then fill'd with reverence and delight
back to the world i take my flight
back to my much lov'd groves again
where honest joys alternate reign
where thro' creation's mighty round
unnumber'd miracles abound
and form'd instruction to convey
the almighty father's power display
amaz'd i view the splendid dye
of this enamel'd butterfly
amaz'd each reptile insect see
each blest with life as well as we
wherever we direct our eyes
ten thousand various forms arise
on each a life of different mode
by boundless providence bestow'd
from small to less from high to higher
till reason sense and fancy tire
while all in due proportion shine
to prove the economy divine
with serious joy the enlighten'd soul
surveys a part admires the whole
nor always silently surveys
but fir'd by gratitude to praise
in holy confidence is blest
and calmly waits eternal rest
when phoebus's beams are withdrawn from our sight
we admire his fair sister the regent of night
tho' languid her beauty tho' feeble her ray
yet still she's akin to the god of the day
when susan like cynthia has finish'd her reign
then charlotte like phoebus shall shine out again
as catholic bigots fall humble before
the pictures of those whom in heart they adore
which tho' known to be nothing but canvas and paint
yet are said to enliven their zeal to the saint
so to susan i bow charming charlotte for she
has just beauty enough to remind me of thee
inconstant and faithless in love's the pretence
on which you arraign me pray hear my defence
such censures as these to my credit redound
i acknowledge and thank a good appetite for't
when ven'son and claret are not to be found
i can make a good meal upon mutton and port
tho'a highclear's so fine that a prince would not scorn it
tho' nature and taste have combin'd to adorn it
yet the artist that owns it wou'd think it severe
were a law made to keep him there all round the year
how enrag'd wou'd the rector ofb boscoville look
if the king should enjoin him to read but one book
and how would his audience their fortune bemoan
if he gave them no sermons but what were his own
'tis variety only makes appetite last
and by changing our dishes we quicken our taste
long was the great figg by the prizefighting swains
sole monarch acknowledg'd of marybone plains
to the towns far and near did his valour extend
and swam down the river from thame to gravesend
where liv'd mr sutton pipemaker by trade
who hearing that figg was thought such a stout blade
resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame
and so sent to challenge the champion of thame
with alternate advantage two trials had past
when they fought out the rubbers on wednesday last
to see such a contest the house was so full
there hardly was room left to thrust in your skull
with a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted
and two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted
till weary at last with inferior disasters
all the company cry'd come the masters the masters
whereupon the bold sutton first mounted the stage
made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage
then figg with a visage so fierce yet sedate
came and enter'd the lists with his freshshaven pate
their arms were encircled with armigers too
with a red ribbon sutton's and figg's with a blue
thus adorn'd the two heroes 'twixt shoulder and elbow
shook hands and went to 't and the word it was bilboe
sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators
was never yet seen in our amphitheatres
our commons and peers from their several places
to half an inch distance all pointed their faces
while the rays of old phoebus that shot thro' the skylight
seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight
and the gods without doubt if one cou'd but have seen 'em
were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em
figg struck the first stroke and with such a vast fury
that he broke his huge weapon in twain i assure you
and if his brave rival this blow had not warded
his head from his shoulders had quite been discarded
figg arm'd him again and they took t' other tilt
and then sutton's blade ran away from its hilt
the weapons were frighted but as for the men
in truth they ne'er minded but at it again
such a force in their blows you'd have thought it a wonder
every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder
yet so great was their courage so equal their skill
that they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill
while in doubtful attention dame victory stood
and which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood
but remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay
without ever stirring an inch either way
till jove to the gods signified his intention
in a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention
but the upshot on 't was that at that very bout
from a wound in figg's side the hot blood spouted out
her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain
but figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain
shew'd the gash and appeal'd to the company round
if his own broken sword had not given him the wound
that bruises and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch
with danger so little with honour so much
well they both took a dram and return'd to the battle
and with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle
while sutton's right arm was observed to bleed
by a touch from his rival so jove had decreed
just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor
but made up like figg's of the common redliquor
again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on
'till the company cry'd hold enough of cold iron
to the quarterstaff now lads so first having dram'd it
they took to their woods and i' faith never sham'd it
the first bout they had was so fair and so handsome
that to make a fair bargain was worth a king's ransom
and sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted
wou'd have made any fibres but figg's to have smarted
then after that bout they went on to another
but the matter must end on some fashion or other
so jove told the gods he hath made a decree
that figg shou'd hit sutton a stroke on the knee
tho' sutton disabled as soon as he hit him
wou'd still have fought on but jove wou'd not permit him
'twas his fate not his fault that constrain'd him to yield
and thus the great figg became lord of the field
old plumb who tho' blest in his kentish retreat
still thrives by his oilshop in leadenhallstreet
with a portugal merchant a knight by creation
from a borough in cornwall receiv'd invitation
wellassur'd of each vote well equip't from the alley
in quest of electionadventures they sally
tho' much they discours'd the long way to beguile
of the earthquakes the jews and the change of the stile
of the irish the stocks and the lott'ry committee
they came silent and tir'd into exeter city
some books prithee landlord to pass a dull hour
no nonsense of parsons or methodists sour
no poetical stuff a damn'd jingle of rhimes
but some pamphlet that's new and a touch on the times
o lord says mine host you may hunt the town round
i question if any such thing can be found
i never was ask'd for a book by a guest
and i'm sure i have all the great folk in the west
none of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book
but see sir the woman with fish and the cook
here's the fattest of carp shall we dress you a brace
would you have any soals or a mullet or plaice
a place quoth the knight we must have to be sure
but first let us see that our borough's secure
we'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll
they may dress us for supper the mullet and soal
but do you my good landlord look over your shelves
for a book we must have we're so tired of ourselves
in troth sir i ne'er had a book in my life
but the prayer book and bible i bought for my wife
well the bible must do but who don't you take in
some monthly collection the new magazine
the bible was brought and laid out on the table
and open'd at jotham's most apposite fable
sir freeport began with this verse tho' no rhime
the trees of the forest went forth on a time
to what purpose our candidates scarce could expect
for it was not they found to transplant but elect
to the olive and figtree their deputies came
but by both were refus'd and their answer the same
quoth the olive shall i leave my fatness and oil
for an unthankful office a dignified toil
shall i leave quoth the figtree my sweetness and fruit
to be envy'd or slav'd in so vain a pursuit
thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine
he answer'd shall i leave my grapes and my wine
wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man
to be made or the tool or the head of a clan
at last as it always falls out in a scramble
the mob gave the cry for a bramble a bramble
a bramble for ever o chance unexpected
but bramble prevail'd and was duly elected
o ho quoth the knight with a look most profound
now i see there's some good in good books to be found
i wish i had read this same bible before
of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore
you plumb with your olives and oil might have staid
and myself might have tarried my wines to unlade
what have merchants to do from their business to ramble
your electioneererrant should still be a bramble
thus ended at once the wise comment on jotham
and our citizens' jaunt to the borough of gotham
hous'd within the cowslip's bell
as the simple milk maids tell
shunning there the glare of day
fairies pass their hours away
there they keep their mimic state
there the fall of night await
then along their fav'rite hill
or beside some haunted rill
whilst around dull mortals sleep
mystic vigils there they keep
with some wild fantastic rite
greeting still the pow'r of night
a fakeer a religious well known in the east
not much like a parson still less like a priest
with no canting no sly jesuitical arts
fieldpreaching hypocrisy learning or parts
by a happy refinement in mortification
grew the oracle saint and the pope of his nation
but what did he do this esteem to acquire
did he torture his head or his bosom with fire
was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd
did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist
no his holiness rose to this sovereign pitch
by the merit of running long nails in his breech
a wealthy young indian approaching the shrine
thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine
this tribute accept for your int'rest with fo
whom with torture you serve and whose will you must know
to your suppliant disclose his immortal decree
tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me
let me first know your merits
to be true to my friend to my wife to my trust
in religion i duly observe ev'ry form
with an heart to my country devoted and warm
i give to the poor and i lend to the rich
but how many nails do you run in your breech
with submission i speak to your rev'rence's tail
but mine has no taste for a tenpenny nail
well i'll pray to our prophet and get you prefer'd
though no farther expect than to heaven the third
with me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain
you must qualify duly with hunger and pain
with you in the thirtieth you impudent rogue
can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue
though the priesthood of fo on the vulgar impose
by squinting whole years at the end of their nose
though with cruel devices of mortification
they adore a vain idol of modern creation
does the god of the heav'ns such a service direct
can his mercy approve a selfpunishing sect
will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails
or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails
come along to my house and these penances leave
give your belly a feast and your breech a reprieve
this reas'ning unhing'd each fanatical notion
and stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion
at length with reluctance he rose from his seat
and resigning his nails and his fame for retreat
two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd
the third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd
to live undistinguish'd to him was the pain
an existence unnotic'd he could not sustain
in retirement he sigh'd for the famegiving chair
for the crowd to admire him to rev'rence and stare
no endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail
he the saintship resum'd and new larded his tail
our fakeer represents all the vot'ries of fame
their ideas their means and their end is the same
the sportsman the buck all the heroes of vice
with their gallantry lewdness the bottle and dice
the poets the critics the metaphysicians
the courtier the patriot all politicians
the slatesman begirt with th' importunate ring
i had almost compleated my list with the king
all labour alike to illustrate my tale
all tortur'd by choice with th' invisible nail
now he storm begins to lower
haste the loom of hell prepare
o iron sleet of arrowy shower
p hurtles in the darken'd air
glittering lances are the loom
where the dusky warp we strain
weaving many a soldier's doom
orkney's woe and randver's bane
see the grisly texture grow
'tis of human entrails made
and the weights that play below
each a gasping warriour's head
shafts for shuttles dipt in gore
shoot the trembling cords along
sword that once a monarch bore
keep the tissue close and strong
mista black terrific maid
sangrida and hilda see
join the wayward work to aid
'tis the woof of victory
ere the ruddy sun be set
pikes must shiver javelins sing
blade with clattering buckler meet
hauberk crash and helmet ring
weave the crimson web of war
let us go and let us fly
where our friends the conflict share
where they triumph where they die
as the paths of fate we tread
wading thro' th' ensanguin'd field
gondula and geira spread
o'er the youthful king your shield
we the reins to slaughter give
ours to kill and ours to spare
spite of danger he shall live
they whom once the desartbeach
pent within its bleak domain
soon their ample sway shall stretch
o'er the plenty of the plain
low the dauntless earl is laid
gor'd with many a gaping wound
fate demands a nobler head
soon a king shall bite the ground
long his loss shall eirin weep
ne'er again his likeness see
long her strains in sorrow sleep
strains of immortality
horror covers all the heath
clouds of carnage blot the sun
sisters weave the web of death
sisters cease the work is done
hail the task and hail the hands
songs of joy and triumph sing
joy to the victorious bands
triumph to the younger king
mortal thou that hear'st the tale
learn the tenour of our song
scotland thro' each winding vale
far and wide the notes prolong
sisters hence with spurs of speed
each her thundering faulchion wield
each bestride her sable steed
hurry hurry to the field
now the storm begins to lower
ironsleet of arrowy shower
hurtles in the darkened air
each a gasping warrior's head
shafts for shuttles dipped in gore
wading through the ensanguined field
they whom once the desertbeach
gored with many a gaping wound
long her strains in sorrow steep
learn the tenor of our song
scotland through each winding vale
mother breedwell presented her husband each year
with a chopping brave boy and sometimes with apair
'till the primitive blessing of multiplication
had fill'd the whole house with a young generation
but as that increased so sorrow and care
those primitive curses put in for a share
and the toilsome employments of mother and wise
had hag'd the poor woman half out of her life
to the doctor she goes with a pitiful face
and begs he wou'd give his advice in her case
she tells him her husband was wretchedly poor
and prays he'd consider her chargeable store
and prevent for the future her having of more
as for that quoth the sage i've a cure never failing
which neither hippocrates thought of nor galen
look here i present you this wonderful hose
into which ev'ry night when you bed with your spouse
thrust both legs nor pull off the magical fetters
till you rise in the morn about family matters
observe but this rule which i give you in charge
and your stock may diminish but never enlarge
many thanks for your kindness dear sir quoth the dame
here she drop'd him a curt'sie if it were not for shame
and for fear you shou'd think me too bold i'd fain beg
t' other shocking and so have a hose to each leg
for if such rare virtue's contained in one
how safe shou'd i be had i both of them on
cupid one day ask'd his mother
when she meant that he shou'd wed
you're too young my boy she said
nor has nature made another
fit to match with cupid's bed
cupid then her sight directed
to a lately wedded pair
where himself the match effected
they as youthful they as fair
having by example carry'd
this first point in the dispute
worseley next he said's not marry'd
her's with cupid's charms may suit
damon why so cold and serious
wherefore that reluctant bow
why so haughty and imperious
say have you forgot me now
tho array'd in coarse attire
you may read lycander's face
for 'tis him my gentle squire
justled in a homely case
true no shining slaves surround me
and my brows with sorrow bend
fortune left me as she found me
yet let damon own his friend
sir your servant and all that sir
but indeed i am in haste
surely pray keep on your hat sir
i have somewhere seen your face
am i grown so great a stranger
yet 'tis hardly half a year
since you vow'd in e'ery danger
not your life was half so dear
sure the court is mighty lulling
not the streams of lethe more
e'en the groom and dirty scullion
know not those they lov'd before
so on that fatal day you did
the levee of his grace attend
you of your memory was rid
i of my fortune and my friend
'tis bus'ness sir that fills my head
believe me now i cannot stay
i'll order half a pint of red
and if you'll drink it sir you may
what friendship is ardelia shew
'tis to love as i love you
this account so short tho' kind
suits not my enquiring mind
therefore farther now repeat
what is friendship when compleat
'tis to share all joy and grief
'tis to lend all due relief
from the tongue the heart the hand
'tis to mortgage house and land
for a friend be sold a slave
'tis to die upon a grave
if a friend therein do lie
this indeed tho' carry'd high
this tho' more than e'er was done
underneath the rolling sun
this has all been said before
can ardelia say no more
words indeed no more can shew
but 'tis to love as i love you
aweful hero marlb'rough rise
sleepy charms i come to break
higher turn thy languid eyes
lo thy genius calls awake
well survey this faithful plan
with records thy life's great story
'tis a short but crowded span
full of triumphs full of glory
one by one thy deeds review
sieges battles thick appear
former wonders lost in new
greatly fill each pompous year
this is blenheim's crimson field
wet with gore with slaughter stain'd
here retiring squadrons yield
and a bloodless wreath is gain'd
ponder in thy godlike mind
all the wonders thou hast wrought
tyrants from their pride declin'd
be the subject of thy thought
rest thee here while life may last
th' utmost bliss to man allow'd
is to trace his actions past
and to own them great and good
but 'tis gone a mortal born
swift the fading scenes remove
let them pass with noble scorn
thine are worlds which roll above
poets prophets heroes kings
pleas'd thy ripe approach foresee
men who acted wond'rdus things
tho' they yield in same to thee
foremost in the patriotband
shining with distinguish'd day
see thy friend godolphin stand
see he beckons thee away
yonder seats and fields of light
let thy ravish'd thought explore
wishing panting for thy flight
half an angel man no more
quoth john to his teacher good sir if you please
i wou'd beg your advice in a difficult case
'tis a weighty concern that may hold one for life
'tis in short the old story of taking a wife
there's a pair of young damsels i'm proffer'd to marry
and whether to choose puts me in a quandary
they're alike in age family fortune and feature
only one has more grace and the other goodnature
as for that says the teacher goodnature and love
and sweetness of temper are gifts from above
and as coming from thence we shou'd give 'em their due
grace is a superior blessing 'tis true
ay sir i remember an excellent sarment
wherein all along you gave grace the preferment
i shall never forget it as how you were telling
that heaven resided where grace had its dwelling
why john quoth the teacher that's true but alas
what heaven can do is quite out of the case
for by day and by night with the woman you wed
'tis you that must board and 'tis you that must bed
and a goodnatur'd girl may quickly grow gracious
but a sourheaded saint will be ever vexatious
who the purple ev'ning lie
on the mountain's lonely van
beyond the noise of busy man
painting fair the form of things
while the yellow linet sings
or the tuneful nightingale
charms the forest with her tale
come with all thy various hues
come and aid thy sister muse
now while phoebus riding high
gives lustre to the land and sky
grongar hill invites my song
draw the landskip bright and strong
grongar in whose mossy cells
sweetly musing quiet dwells
grongar in whose silent shade
for the modest muses made
so oft i have the evening still
at the fountain of a rill
sate upon a flow'ry bed
with my hand beneath my head
while stray'd my eyes o'er towy's flood
over mead and over wood
from house to house from hill to hill
'till contemplation had her fill
about his chequer'd sides i wind
and leave his brooks and meads behind
and groves and grottoes where i lay
and vistoes shooting beams of day
wide and wider spreads the vale
as circles on a smooth canal
the mountains round unhappy fate
sooner or later all of height
withdraw their summits from the skies
and lessen as the others rise
still the prospect wider spreads
adds a thousand woods and meads
still it widens widens still
and sinks the newlyrisen hill
now i gain the mountain's brow
what a landskip lies below
no clouds no vapours intervene
but the gay the open scene
does the face of nature show
in all the hues of heaven's bow
and swelling to embrace the light
spreads around beneath the sight
old castles on the cliffs arise
proudly tow'ring in the skies
rushing from the woods the spires
seem from hence ascending fires
half his beams apollo sheds
on the yellow mountainheads
gilds the fleeces of the flocks
and glitters on the broken rocks
below me trees unnumber'd rise
beautiful in various dyes
the gloomy pine the poplar blue
the yellow beech the sable yew
the slender fir that taper grows
the sturdy oak with broadspread boughs
and beyond the purple grove
haunt of phillis queen of love
gaudy as the op'ning dawn
lies a long and level lawn
on which a dark hill steep and high
holds and charms the wand'ring eye
deep are his feet in towy's flood
his sides are cloath'd with waving wood
and ancient towers crown his brow
that cast an aweful look below
whose ragged walls the ivy creeps
and with her arms from falling keeps
so both a safety from the wind
on mutual dependence find
'tis now the raven's bleak abode
'tis now th' apartment of the toad
and there the fox securely feeds
and there the pois'nous adder breeds
conceal'd in ruins moss and weeds
while ever and anon there falls
huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls
yet time has seen that lifts the low
and level lays the lofty brow
has seen this broken pile compleat
big with the vanity of state
but transient is the smile of fate
a little rule a little sway
a sun beam in a winter's day
is all the proud and mighty have
between the cradle and the grave
and see the rivers how they run
thro' woods and meads in shade and sun
sometimes swift sometimes slow
wave succeeding wave they go
a various journey to the deep
like human life to endless sleep
thus is nature's vesture wrought
to instruct our wand'ring thought
thus she dresses green and gay
to disperse our cares away
ever charming ever new
when will the landskip tire the view
the fountain's fall the river's flow
the woody vallies warm and low
the windy summit wild and high
roughly rushing on the sky
the pleasant seat the ruin'd tow'r
the naked rock the shady bow'r
the town and village dome and farm
each give each a double charm
as pearls upon an aethiop's arm
see on the mountain's southern side
where the prospect opens wide
where the evening gilds the tide
how close and small the hedges lie
what streaks of meadows cross the eye
a step methinks may pass the stream
so little distant dangers seem
so we mistake the future's face
ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass
as yon summits soft and fair
clad in colours of the air
which to those who journey near
barren brown and rough appear
still we tread the same coarse way
the present's still a cloudy day
o may i with myself agree
and never covet what i see
content me with an humble shade
my passions tam'd my wishes laid
for while our wishes wildly roll
we banish quiet from the soul
'tis thus the busy beat the air
and misers gather wealth and care
now ev'n now my joys run high
as on the mountainturf i lie
while the wanton zephyr sings
and in the vale perfumes his wings
while the waters murmur deep
while the shepherd charms his sheep
while the birds unbounded fly
and with musick fill the sky
be full ye courts be great who will
search for peace with all your skill
open wide the lofty door
seek her on the marble floor
in vain you search she is not there
in vain ye search the domes of care
grass and flowers quiet treads
on the meads and mountainheads
along with pleasure close ally'd
ever by each other's side
and often by the murm'ring rill
hears the thrush while all is still
within the groves of grongar hill
swains of high or low degree
poets peers whate'er you be
ye who pen the lofty lay
or who sigh and nothing say
ye who talk of flames and darts
radiant eyes and marble hearts
say for lovers never lie
are ye half so blest as i
lo at stella's feet i lay
and at night when she's undress'd
next her bed behold i'm plac'd
swains can you these favours see
and not envy happy me
i sustain the tripping maid
easy tho' to all and free
yet she foots it but with me
or at church or at the play
if she ogle or she pray
when she trips along the meads
or on persian carpets treads
in the sprightly month of may
fatal month some authors say
i both morning noon and night
order all her steps aright
who durst say when i was by
stella ever trod awry
her support unto my end
if a pilgrim she should go
where the streams of jordan flow
i'll sustain her in the way
where the streams of jordan stray
weary tho' and faint she be
all her cares shall rest on me
venus in her shape and air
cruel tho' nor does she know
half the pain i undergo
tall and comely tho' she be
owes she not an inch to me
me on whom she treads and tramples
o the force of ill examples
die forsaken lovers die
favour'd less tho' true as i
so's the heelpiece to the heel
true and constant and will never
from her shoe or slipper fever
till the sole as ah it must
seeks its resting place in dust
as from envy who is free
come pour out your last adieus
die and heelpiece stella's shoes
at the close of the day when the hamlet is still
and mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove
when nought but the torrent is heard on the hill
and nought but the nightingale's song in the grove
'twas then by the cave of a mountain reclin'd
an hermit his nightly complaint thus began
tho' mournful his voice his heart was resign'd
he thought as a sage but he felt as a man
ah why thus abandon'd to mourning and woe
why thus lonely philomel slows thy sad strain
for spring shall return and a lover bestow
and thy bosom no trace of dejection retain
yet if pity inspire thee ah cease not thy lay
mourn sweetest complainer man calls thee to mourn
o soothe him whose pleasures like thine pass away
full swiftly they pass but they never return
now gliding remote on the verge of the sky
the moon half extinct her wan crescent displays
yet lately i saw where majestic on high
she shone and the stars were conceal'd in her rays
roil on thou fair orb and with gladness pursue
the path that conducts thee to splendor again
but man's faded glory no change shall renew
ah fool to exult in a glory so vain
'tis dark and the landscape is lovely no more
i mourn not ye woodlands i mourn not for you
for morn shall return all your charms to restore
perfum'd with fresh fragrance and glittering with dew
nor yet for the ravage of winter i mourn
kind nature the embryo blossoms shall save
but when shall spring visit the mouldering urn
oh when shall it dawn on the gloom of the grave
see from yonder hill descending
hope with all her train attending
quips and cranks and wanton wiles
nods and becks and wreathed smiles
fancies light that tread on air
building fairy castles there
olus his harp new stringing
tuning to the breezes singing
zeph'rus sweeping softest chords
fancy setting airs to words
words that seem another sound
and lighter than a breath are found
here morpheus comes a wandering guest
by plaintive murmurs lull'd to rest
round him painted vapours stream
weaving soft the chequer'd dream
which on silken wings they spread
shaking o'er his drowsy head
subtile fumes waft round the brain
and fan these joys so light and vain
which soft slumber loves to dress
in long robes of happiness
see where come the dancing hours
sprinkling hope's gay path with flowers
thyme that loves the brown hill's side
heath in lasting colours dyed
feathery sprays that softly blow
and lead the sweet gales as they go
unheeded though the scented air
fragrance steals we know not where
sweet hope lightly dost thou tread
bending not the weak flower's head
watching every changeful scene
sliding gilded shows between
where new prospects open still
rising fair behind the hill
'tis true stern reason scorns thy sway
nor basks beneath thy sunny ray
nor hears thy accents clear and sweet
where sprightly airs and softness meet
mixing with harmonic chords
pouring melody on words
nor will his fix'd eye deign to glance
on the mirthful mazy dance
when the hours all hand in hand
link with thee a jocund band
when thy white robes float on air
catching rays that tremble there
tinted with the varying beam
ending in prismatic stream
on thy head a wreath of flowers
nods in time to dancing hours
featheryfooted trim and light
flitting round from morn till night
from morn till night thou gaily leads
through dark green woods and painted meads
with roseting'd cheeks and clear blue eye
looking through another sky
till we reach th' enamell'd lawn
round which a river journeys on
where many a bridge is taught to please
gothic eyes or gay chinese
thrown in every point of view
arch can add a beauty to
while here and there an ashling weaves
verdant knots of summer leaves
now we reach thy mansion high
spiral turrets climb the sky
gilding clouds of varied light
changing underneath the sight
see what crowds surround the gate
see what expectations wait
and running out surround their queen
ask all at once where she has been
and if the promis'd hours were found
with elysian garlands crown'd
or if yet she'd leave to tell
where true happiness would dwell
or yet had seen the promis'd day
when expectation grave or gay
in happy blissful bands should be
united into certainty
she sweetly smil'd and wav'd her hand
at which a specious flattering band
quick through the ear their credence reaches
bow'd round and full of soothing speeches
declar'd the hours would soon appear
then whispering softly in the ear
taught smiles along the cheek to glow
as if those hours they well did know
ye promises ye flatterers vain
that dress out hope and varnish pain
and make the dullest things appear
of shining surface smooth and clear
handing the cup to hope's sweet lip
of which we guests so fondly sip
while seeing all the bottom shine
ne'er think there's poison in the wine
dark lethe's cup each grief subdues
that used on former joys to muse
for to hope's enchanted dome
dreaded ills dare never come
not one mask'd sorrow can you see
in all her court of revelry
what though ye pull the careless sleeve
and would tempt us to believe
these noonjoys are waning fast
form'd only for an hour to last
hence miscreants let me while i may
enjoy the gewgaws of my day
descend sweet hope from thy bright throne
glittering with each precious stone
rubies red and sapphires blue
amethysts of purple hue
topazes of sunlike blaze
and diamonds with their thousand rays
descend and mount yon hill with me
there let me opening prospects see
which step by step shall fairer grow
the while as fades this scene below
forests of immortal oak
rocks by tumbling torrents broke
shallow brooks and rivers wide
verdant meads with daisies pied
distant cities large and proud
mountains dim that seem a cloud
castles high that live on hills
little cots that seek the rills
upland grounds where flocks are seen
mixing white with darkest green
what though painted on the air
still they look serene and fair
though my foot be left to tread
barren heaths with brambles spread
yet if thou check one falling tear
or bathe the eye till it grow clear
i'll freely pardon all thy wiles
and fancy good in all thy smiles
still pleas'd to find the ills we dread
thy fairy wing can overspread
and though thy promises deceive
bless my kind stars that i believe
thy cranks and wiles who would not see
for happy they who doubt not thee
my pipe sounds a cheerfuller note
my crook is new garnish'd with flowers
this day to sweet thoughts i devote
where blossom the eglantine bowers
my sheep unattended may stray
where clover impurples the plain
my dog unregarded may play
till morning rise on him again
'tis fit that they too should partake
of the joy that enlivens my soul
at night i'll repair to the wake
and merrily quaff the full bowl
just now as i walk'd thro' the grove
i met my dear delia there
and told her a tale of my love
which she seem'd with soft pleasure to hear
a blush like the blush of the dawn
stole over her beautiful cheek
smiles sweeter than infants newborn
told more than i wish'd her to speak
i stole from her hand a sweet kiss
nor tried she to draw it away
no description comes up to the bliss
that reigns in my bosom to day
methinks every zephyr that blows
soft music conveys to my ear
methinks every floweret that grows
more blooming and fresh does appear
the birds tune their musical throats
and sing most delightfully sweet
in soft and more delicate notes
sweet echo my sighs does repeat
long time did a silly old proverb prevail
that meat drink and cloth were all found in good ale
'till a lover of truth went on purpose to hull
and to try the experiment drank his skin full
he began to see visions his head it turn'd round
'till off from his keffal he fell on the ground
there in trances profound our philosopher mellow
lay all night in the snow consulting his pillow
oracular vapours give prophecy birth
as plutarch reports springing out of the earth
whether this was the cause or however inspir'd
our sage gave a sentence will be ever admir'd
'twas this i pronounce that good ale is good meat
for i find i have no inclination to eat
that good ale is good cloth you may honestly boast
for i' faith i'm as blithe and as warm as a toast
but to call it good drink is a lye i'll be sworn
for i ne'er was so dry since the hour i was born
the cloth cries a punster who chanc'd to come by
must be a good drap if it kept you so dry
praise to god immortal praise
for the love that crowns our days
bounteous source of every joy
let thy praise our tongues employ
for the blessings of the field
for the stores the garden yield
for the vine's exalted juice
for the generous olive's use
flocks that whiten all the plain
yellow sheaves of ripen'd grain
clouds that drop their fatt'ning dews
suns that temperate warmth diffuse
all that spring with bounteous hand
scatters o'er the smiling land
all that liberal autumn pours
from her rich o'erflowing stores
these to thee my god we owe
source whence all our blessings flow
and for these my soul shall raise
grateful vows and solemn praise
yet should rising whirlwinds tear
from its stem the ripening ear
should the figtree's blasted shoot
drop her green untimely fruit
should the vine put forth no more
nor the olive yield her store
though the sick'ning flocks should fall
and the herds desert the stall
should thine alter'd hand restrain
the early and the latter rain
blast each opening bud of joy
and the rising year destroy
yet to thee my soul should raise
and when every blessing's flown
love thee for thyself alone
naiad of this healthful stream
fair laurentia if i deem
rightly of thy office here
if the theme may please thine ear
listen gracious to my lays
while the springs of health i praise
nor will less thy glory shine
if their praise i blend with thine
for of their renown of old
stories many fame hath told
ancient bards their name have sung
heroes kings and gods among
and with various titles grac'd
while their fountainhead they trac'd
whethera bladud king of yore
skill'd in philosophic lore
mingling various kinds of earth
metallic gave the waters birth
king'sbath nam'd beneath thy feet
boiling ay with mineral heat
or whether from his car on high
phoebus saw with amorous eye
the fountainnymph with humid train
light of foot trip o'er the plain
strait the god inflam'd with love
swift descending from above
all in fervors bright array'd
press'd her bosom and the maid
gladly to his warm embrace
yielded whence the happy place
where the nymph he woo'd and won
was call'd theb waters of the sun
fame that title widely spred
yet ere roman legions fled
the wrath of sturdy british knights
pallas claim'd religious rights
britishc palladour then rose
from the goddess nam'd who chose
near the favourite streams to dwell
guardian of the sacred well
but long sinced hygeia fair
under her peculiar care
receiv'd the springs for well she knows
each salubrious rill that flows
forth from subterranean vaults
stor'd by nature's hand with salts
steel or sulphur for her use
nature opens every sluice
which hygeia gives in charge
to sev'ral nymphs herself at large
roams o'er hill and dale and plain
lacky'd by a duteous train
oreads naiads dryads pay
service glad some smooth her way
or mists disperse or brush the trees
others waft the morningbreeze
from mountaintops adown the hills
others pour refreshing rills
or bathe her limbs in fountain neat
aiding all her influence sweet
she with smiling eye surveys
rustic labours and conveys
strength to the active thresher's arm
to villagemaidens beauty's charm
happy are the sons of earth
whom the goddess at their birth
shin'd on yet her heavenly ray
numbers not respecting stray
from her presence and pursue
luxury's paths whose sordid crew
lust inordinate and sloth
and gluttony's unwieldy growth
lead them on to shame and pain
and maladies an endless train
oft with pangs distracting torn
they hygeia's absence mourn
bitter change their languid eyes
feel not joy in sunny skies
nor doth night with slumber blest
close them at the hour of rest
and oft with sighs and tears and pray'r
halfsuppress'd by sad despair
they the queen of health implore
her wish'd presence to restore
nor unmindful of their woes
is the goddess for me chose
thee laurentia loveliest maid
among thy sister nymphs who play'd
on the banks ofe avon thee
brightey'd nymph she chose to be
her substitute and pow'r she gave
sov'reign o'er the healing wave
which thou rul'st with gentle sway
thee the smoaking tides obey
joyous and at thy command
wash thyf rosyfinger'd hand
thence in crystal cups convey'd
yield their salutary aid
to all whom thou with look benign
smil'st on round hygeia's shrine
all of appetite deprav'd
those whom paleey'd spleen enslav'd
cripples bent with gouty pain
whom jaundice ting'd with muddy stain
or whose frame of nerves with stroke
benumming tremulous palsy broke
these the balmy cordial stream
quaff rejoicing thee their theme
of praise extol thy tender care
thy soft address and courteous air
and whileg harmony the friend
of health delights to recommend
thy ministry thy charms inspire
love and joy and gay desire
for the goddess when she gave
rule imperial o'er the wave
to adorn the gift and grace thy state
on thee bade youth and beauty wait
nor dost thou not taste delight
where thou sit'st in duteous plight
for the joy thy hand bestows
back to thee redounding flows
when the cheek of faded hue
thou seest displaying roses new
thee suspendedg crutches please
signal trophies from disease
won to health victorious hail
comfort and support of frail
human state hail blooming maid
nymph belov'd without thy aid
he who greeting thee his lays
now attunes to notes of praise
mute had been oppress'd with pain
of spasm rheumatic hail again
priestess of hygeia's shrine
still dispense her gift divine
still her vot'ries lead to health
else what profits marlborough's wealth
h eliza's form and stanhope's wit
and all the eloquence of pitt
see the lovely morning rise
see her glories paint the skies
half o'er the reviving globe
gaily spreads her saffron robe
see the hills with flowers crown'd
and the valleys laughing round
mira to aurora sings
while the lark exulting springs
high in air and tunes her throat
to a soft and merry note
the goldfinch and the linnet join
hail aurora nymph divine
see clione's gilded car
see it blazes from afar
here the fair one bends her way
balmy zephyrs round her play
now she lights upon the vale
fond to meet the western gale
may this artless praise be thine
soft clione half divine
see her snowy hand she waves
silent stand her waiting slaves
and while they guard the silver reins
she wanders lonely o'er the plains
see those cheeks of beauteous dye
lovely as the dawning sky
innocence that ne'er beguiles
lips that wear eternal smiles
beauties to the rest unknown
shine in her and her alone
now the rivers smoother flow
now the op'ning roses glow
the woodbine twines her odorous charms
round the oaks supporting arms
lilies paint the dewy ground
and ambrosia breathes around
come ye gales that fan the spring
zephyr with thy downy wing
gently waft to mira's breast
health content and balmy rest
far o far from hence remain
sorrow care and sickly pain
thus sung mira to her lyre
till the idle numbers tire
ah sappho sweeter sings i cry
and the spiteful rocks reply
responsive to the jarring strings
sweeter sappho sweeter sings
lend thy voice celestial maid
through thy vocal grove convey'd
let a sudden call from thee
wake my soul to harmony
raise oh raise the hallow'd strain
mistress of the tuneful train
and thou sacred source of light
author of our mystic rite
thou whom erst latona bore
on the seagirt delian shore
join the fav'ring muse and shed
all thy influence on my head
be still ye vaulted skies be still
each hollow vale each echoing hill
let earth and seas and winds attend
ye birds awhile your notes suspend
be hush'd each sound behold him nigh
parent of sacred harmony
he comes his unshorn hair behind
loose floating to the wanton wind
hail sire of day whose rosy car
through the pathless fields of air
by thy winged coursers borne
opes the eyelids of the morn
thou whose locks their light display
o'er the wide aetherial way
wreathing their united rays
into one promiscuous blaze
under thy allseeing eye
earth's remotest corners lie
while in thy repeated course
issuing from thy fruitful source
floods of fire incessant stray
streams of everlasting day
round thy sphere the starry throng
varying sweet their ceaseless song
while their vivid flames on high
deck the clear untroubled sky
to the tuneful lyre advance
joining in the mystic dance
and with step alternate beat
old olympus' lofty seat
at their head the wakeful moon
drives her milkwhite heifers on
and with measur'd pace and even
glides around the vast of heaven
journeying with unwearied force
and rejoicing in her course
time attends with swift career
and forms the circle of the year
nemesis whose dreaded weight
turns the scale of human fate
on whose front black terrors dwell
daughter dire of justice hail
thou whose adamantine rein
curbs the arrogant and vain
wrong and force before thee die
envy shuns thy searching eye
and her sable wings outspread
flies to hide her hated head
where thy wheel with restless round
runs along th' unprinted ground
humbled there at thy decree
human greatness bows the knee
thine it is unseen to trace
step by step each mortal's pace
thine the sons of pride to check
and to bend the stubborn neck
till our lives directed stand
by the measure in thy hand
thou observant sit'st on high
with bent brow and stedfast eye
weighing all that meets thy view
in thy balance just and true
goddess look propitious down
view us but without a frown
nemesis be still our theme
power immortal and supreme
thee we praise nor thee alone
but add the partner of thy throne
thee and justice both we sing
justice whose unwearied wing
rears aloft the virtuous name
safe from hell's rapacious claim
and when thou thy wrath hast shed
turns it from the guiltless head
i am of a temper fixed as a decree
resolv'd with myself to live happy and free
with the cares of this world i am seldom perplex'd
i am sometimes uneasy but never quite vex'd
i am neither too high nor too low in degree
there are more that live worse than live better than me
my life thus moves on amid freedom and ease
i go where i will and i come when i please
i am plac'd below envy and yet above spite
i've judgment enough still to do myself right
some higher some lower i own there may be
but ambition and want are both strangers to me
when money comes in pleas'd i live till 'tis gone
i am happy when with it contented with none
if i spend it 'mong friends i count it but lent
it thus goes genteelly i never repent
with mirth to my labour the hours sweetly pass
though at saturday night i am just where i was
i'll hae a new coatie when willie comes hame
i'll hae a new plaidie an' a' o' the same
an' i'll hae some pearlings to make mysel fine
for it's a' to delight this dear laddie o' mine
bessy bell is admir'd by a' sorts o' men
i'll mind a' her fashions and how she comes ben
i'll mind her at kirk and i'll mind her at fair
an' never ance try to look like mysel mair
for i'll ay be canty when willie comes hame
to like sic a laddie why should i think shame
though the laird flytes my mither and cries do ye see
that lassie cares nought for my siller or me
the laird he has money the laird he has land
but my willie has nought but the sword in his hand
yet i'd live upon chelsea or even wad beg
should my soldier return wi' a poor wooden leg
for i maun be happy when willie comes hame
to lo'e the dear laddie i'll never think shame
i'll speak up to maggie who often would jeer
and cry she's no canty 'cause willie's no here
i own when i thought i should see him nae mair
my een they grew red and my heart it grew sair
to sing or to dance was nae pleasure to me
though often i danc'd wi' the tear i' my ee
but i'll get to singing an' dancing again
an' i'll get the laddie and a' o' my ain
we've a' things but siller then why should i fret
if there's riches in love we'll hae gear enough yet
for i ken weel that riches can make themselves wings
that heartaches hide under braw diamonds and rings
an' though love canna happiness always ensure
it will help us wi' patience our lot to endure
sae i'll ay be canty when willie comes hame
to lo'e sic a laddie why should i think shame
the lassie cares nought for my siller or me
but willie has nought but the sword in his hand
forbear my dear stephen with a fruitless desire
into truths which are better conceal'd to enquire
perhaps many years are allow'd us by fate
or next winter perhaps is the last of their date
let the credulous fools whom astrologers cheat
exult or despond as they vary deceit
who anticipate care their own pleasure destroy
and invite disappointment who build upon joy
all ills unforeseen we the easiest endure
what avails to foresee unless foresight could cure
and from ills by their art how can wretches be freed
when that art must be false or those ills be decreed
from reflection and hope little comfort we find
to possession alone let thy thoughts be confin'd
today's all the treasure poor mortals can boast
for tomorrow's not gained and yesterday's lost
even now whilst i write time steals on our youth
and a moment's cut off from my friendship and truth
then seize the swift blessing enjoy the dear now
and take not expect what hereafter 'll bestow
from these numbers as they flow
shepherdmaids this moral know
soon shall beauty's brightest bloom
moulder in the cheerless tomb
charms that light the blaze of love
soon the force of time shall prove
vainly beams the glist'ning eye
quench'd in dust each star shall lie
yet when death's destructive dart
chills to rest the beating heart
virtue's flame unquench'd shall burn
cheer the grave and gild the urn
the bishop of chester
though wiser than nestor
and fairer than esther
if you scratch him will fester
here lies edmund keene lord bishop of chester
he eat a fat goose and could not digest her
here lies mrs keene the bishop of chester
she had a bad face which did sadly molest her
here lives harry vane
very good claret and fine champagne
when you rise from your dinner as light as before
'tis a sign you have eat just enough and no more
in that eye where expression has sweetly been taught
to paint a strong picture of reason and thought
yet touch'd with such softness as leads us to know
it can start into rapture or melt into woe
affection beams forth like the rays of the morn
and warms the young rosebud that hope had just born
should words e'er be wanting to speak out more clear
what tenderness hints in a trembling tear
see gentle persuasion just take up her lyre
whose finger all rhetoric gives language to wire
till the voice that we love ever closing the strain
shall dwell on the ear till we hear it again
then tell me no more that you know not to please
with looks so engaging and manners like these
thus the lily all meekness unconscious of power
presumes not to vie with a loftier flower
yet the lover of sweetness must own ere they part
'tis the lily alone he could wear in his heart
in the dream of the moment i call'd for the bowl
but i found that a bumper can't reach the pure soul
though fancy may sparkle as shines the gay glass
or mirth and good humour shake hands as they pass
yet right if i ween for the joys that are past
we know gentle maid that such hours cannot last
ah well do i know for since reason's young dawn
i have mark'd the sweet floweret adorning the lawn
the light leaves of summer that fan us today
one breath of cold winter shall waft them away
since thus it must be since our summers must fade
let us make much of life and enjoy her green shade
in the search of good humour i've rambl'd all day
and just now honest truth has discover'd her way
when rubbing his telescope perfectly clear
call'd out i have found her and bade me come here
i'm grown weary of wit who but dresses for show
and strives still to sparkle as much as your beau
for if he can shine though at dear friends' expense
he will raise contributions on feeling and sense
then learning is proud nor can trifle with ease
though in this little life 'tis oft trifles that please
unbending austerity wrapt up in self
is so like a miser when hoarding his pelf
strong reason's a warrior that fights out his way
and seldom has leisure to rest or to play
nay so rough has he grown unless great things are done
he thinks that all useless went down the bright sun
o 'tis gentle good humour that makes life so sweet
and picks up the flowerets that garnish our feet
then from them extracting the balsam of health
turns the blossoms of nature to true sterling wealth
mortal thou who view'st this cell
scorn not here awhile to dwell
hence is banish'd noisy sport
this is contemplation's court
hermits here in days of yore
o'er their beads were seen to pore
screen'd within this friendly shade
erst has wept the lovelorn maid
oft within this ivy'd seat
tenants of the green retreat
bards have shunn'd the glare of noon
here have hail'd the rising moon
here with glitt'ring visions blest
have they sunk to downy rest
here have wak'd this truth to know
wild ambition leads to woe
whilst around your eyes you turn
from this cell one moral learn
far from fortune's flatt'ring gale
cautious spread your little sail
see yon once aspiring fane
with ruin sad bestrew the plain
whilst within the fretted tower
night's lone bird selects her bower
yet the zealot's ruffian hand
speeding ruin o'er the land
spar'd this rude this humble cell
where contentment chose to dwell
those who from the prelate's hand
tore the crosier's jewel'd wand
bad the shepherd by the brook
keep secure his beechen crook
shepherd would'st thou here obtain
pleasure unalloy'd with pain
joy that suits the rural sphere
gentle shepherd lend an ear
learn to relish calm delight
verdant vales and fountains bright
trees that nod on sloping hills
caves that echo tinkling rills
if thou can'st no charm disclose
in the simplest bud that blows
go forsake thy plain and fold
join the crowd and toil for gold
tranquil pleasures never cloy
banish each tumultuous joy
all but love for love inspires
fonder wishes fiercer fires
love and all its joys be thine
yet ere thou the reins resign
hear what reason seems to say
hear attentive and obey
crimson leaves the rose adorn
but beneath 'em lurks a thorn
fair and flowery is the brake
yet it hides the vengeful snake
think not she whose empty pride
dares the fleecy garb deride
think not she who light and vain
scorns the sheep can love the swain
artless deed and simple dress
mark the chosen shepherdess
thoughts by decency controul'd
well conceiv'd and freely told
sense that shuns each conscious air
wit that falls ere well aware
generous pity prone to sigh
if her kid or lambkin die
let not lucre let not pride
draw thee from such charms aside
have not those their proper sphere
gentler passions triumph here
see to sweeten thy repose
the blossom buds the fountain flows
lo to crown thy healthful board
all that milk and fruits afford
seek no more the rest is vain
pleasure ending soon in pain
anguish lightly gilded o'er
close thy wish and seek no more
hither all ye heav'nly pow'rs
from your empyreal bow'rs
from the fields for ever gay
from the starpav'd milky way
from the moon's relucent horn
from the star that wakes the morn
from the bow whose mingling dyes
sweetly cheer the frowning skies
from the silver cloud that sails
shadowy o'er the darken'd vales
from th' elysiums of the sky
spirits immortal hither fly
fly and through the limpid air
guard in pomp the sliding car
which to his terrestrial throne
wafts britannia's genius down
chiefly ye whose brows divine
crown'd with starry circlets shine
who in various labours try'd
once britannia's strength and pride
now in everlasting rest
share the glories of the blest
peers and nobles of the sky
hither too ye tuneful throng
masters of enchanting song
sacred bards whose rapt'rous strains
sooth the toiling hero's pains
sooth the patriot's gen'rous cares
sweetly thro' their ravish'd ears
whisp'ring to th' immortal mind
heav'nly visions hopes refin'd
hopes of endless peace and fame
safe from envy's blasting flame
pure sincere in those abodes
where to throngs of list'ning gods
hymning bards to virtue's praise
tune their neverdying lays
sweet encomiasts of the sky
fly and charm the limpid air
while the softlysliding car
to his seaencircled throne
gentle spirit we obey
thus along th' aetherial way
we attend our monarch's car
thus we charm the silent air
ye southern gales that ever fly
in frolic april's vernal train
who as ye skim along the sky
dip your light pinions in the main
then shake them fraught with genial show'rs
o'er blooming flora's primrose bow'rs
now cease awhile your wanton sport
now drive each threat'ning cloud away
then to the flow'ry vale resort
and hither all its sweets convey
and ever as ye dance along
with soft murmurs aid our song
but lo fair windsor's tow'rs appear
and hills with spreading oaks imbrown'd
hark hark the voice of joy i hear
sung by a thousand echoes round
and now i view a glitt'ring train
in triumph march o'er yonder plain
hail mighty nation ever fam'd in war
lo heav'n descends thy festivals to share
to view those heroes whose immortal praise
celestial bards shall sing in living lays
disdain not ye blest denizens of air
to breathe this grosser atmosphere awhile
your service i shall need mean time resort
to yon imperial palace and in air
draw up your squadrons in a radiant orb
suspended o'er those lofty battlements
like the bright halo that invests the moon
or saturn's lucid ring thence shed benign
your choicest influence on the noble train
there on this solemn day assembled round
the throne of british edward i awhile
must here await th' approach of other spirits
sage druids britain's old philosophers
fetch'd by my summons from the western isles
that scatter'd o'er the rough hibernian flood
seem like huge fragments by the wild wave torn
from stormy scotland and the cambrian shore
there from the world retir'd in secret shades
chiefly where breint and meinai wash'd the oaks
of ancient mona their academies
and schools of sage and moral discipline
they held and to the neighb'ring britons round
from their rever'd tribunals holy mounts
dispens'd at once their oracles and laws
'till fierce paulinus and his roman bands
them and their gods defying drove them thence
to seek for shelter in hibernian shades
yet still enamour'd of their ancient haunts
unseen of mortal eyes they hover round
their ruin'd altars consecrated hills
once girt with spreading oaks mysterious rows
of rude enormous obelisks that rise
orb within orb stupendous monuments
of artless architecture such as now
oft times amaze the wand'ring traveller
by the pale moon discern'd on sarum's plain
but hence arial spirits lo they come
inform us happy spirit protecting pow'r
of this our ancient country wherefore now
from our sequester'd vallies pensive groves
and dark recesses thou hast summon'd us
to wait thy orders on this flow'ry hill
a great event sage druids that no less
imports than this your ancient country's fame
from contemplation and your silent shades
calls you to meet me on this flow'ry hill
know in yon castle whose proud battlements
sit like a regal crown upon the brow
of highclimbing lawn doth edward hold
this day his solemn session to receive
the pleas of all th' aspiring candidates
who summon'd by theb herald's publick voice
to windsor as to fame's bright temple haste
from ev'ry shore the noble wise and brave
knights senators and statesmen lords and kings
ambitious each to gain the splendid prize
by edward promis'd to transcendent worth
for who of mortals is too great and high
in the career of virtue to contend
of these selecting the most glorious names
doth england's monarch purpose to compose
a princely brotherhood himself the chief
and worthy sov'reign of th' illustrious band
a band of heroes listed in the cause
of honour virtue and celestial truth
under the name and holy patronage
of cappadocian george britannia's saint
such is the plan by gen'rous edward form'd
a plan of glory that beyond the reach
of his own conquering arms shall propagate
the sov'reignty of britain and erect
her monarchs into judges of mankind
but from this day's decisions from the choice
of his first collegues shall succeeding times
of edward judge and on his fame pronounce
for dignities and titles when misplac'd
upon the vicious the corrupt and vile
like princely virgins to low peasants match'd
descend from their nobility and soil'd
by base alliance not their pride alone
and native splendor lose but shame retort
ev'n on the sacred throne from whence they sprung
so may the lustre of this order bright
this eldest child of chivalry be stain'd
if at her first espousals her great sire
caught by the specious outsides that deceive
and captivate the world admit the suit
of vain pretenders void of real worth
light empty bubbles by the wanton gale
of fortune swell'd and only form'd to dance
and glitter in the sunshine of a court
begin we then with edward first let him
at his own high tribunal undergo
the rigid inquisition i for this
have left my lucid starencircled throne
for this immortal sages have requir'd
your wise and prudent ministry well skill'd
in various science and the human heart
search edward's to the bottom sound the depths
and shallows of his soul if he possess
that first of regal talents to discern
with quickey'd penetration thro' the veil
of art each character's intrinsick worth
and all the labyrinths of the human mind
nor blush for this good end yourselves to wear
fallacious forms to plead the cause of false
but specious merit at his throne appear
in borrow'd shapes and there with artful guile
when the shrill trumpet cites the candidates
urge your pretensions all the pow'r employ
of wit and eloquence edward i trust
the trial shall abide which shall but tend
to manifest that not from arrogance
but conscious virtue hath he thus assum'd
above all other kings to be the judge
and great rewarder of heroic deeds
nor wholly unassisted will i leave
my royal charge but with blest influence clear
his intellectual eye from the dim mists
it haply hath contracted from a long
unebbing current of felicity
unhop'd unequall'd triumphs from the view
of captive monarchs and the glitt'ring throng
who at his summons from all climates come
to take as from their sov'reign honours new
when heav'n tries mortals in unusual ways
'tis fit it should afford unusual aid
now sages to yon spreading oaks retire
there wait my summons and mean time advise
how best to execute the task enjoin'd
that hither from your distant residence
by solemn invitation noble guests
i have entreated your illustrious train
misconstrue not to levity and pride
or ostentatious vain magnificence
unworthy the grave majesty of kings
unworthy your atention my renown
this bright assemblage of the wise the brave
the noble the magnificent the fair
the ornaments of europe have i sought
to grace the pomp of virtue to adorn
with noblest off'rings her unspotted shrine
attracting thus to her divine commands
the aweful veneration of mankind
this was the cause great princes this the call
the voice of virtue not of england's king
that with respectful zeal ye hear'd and follow'd
from burgundy's rich vineyards from the meads
of hainault and brabant the rocky wave
of danube from germania's warlike tow'rs
imperial mother of an hundred states
from spain long exercis'd by moorish arms
from italy's fair princedoms and the walls
of seawash'd venice adria's haughty spouse
with me then all ye virtuous by what stile
recorded in the registers of fame
knights senators or soldiers ermin'd lords
or scepter'd princes from whatever clime
ye come ennobled by heroic acts
with me unite the splendor of your names
to dignify th' erection of a new
and noble order which to heav'n's high praise
and to heav'n's champion cappadocian george
on this his holy festival i mean
to found a recompence for worthiest deeds
thus as the orient sun ador'd of old
by prostrate persia ow'd his deity
less to that genial and benignant heat
that cherishes and warms the seeds of life
than to those gorgeous beams that deck with gold
and crimson the gay portals of the morn
so shall this rising order owe its fame
and brightest lustre to the splendid train
of lords and purpled princes who are met
this day to usher and adorn its birth
nor deem that to allure heroic minds
my private int'rests partially to serve
to lift the valiant in ambition's cause
and form a league of conquest i have laid
in subtle policy this great design
asham'd be he who with malignant eye
so reads my purpose and be he accurs'd
whoe'er in aftertimes shall so pervert
this sacred institution to the world
i here consign it to the good and great
of every age and clime and them alone d
now sound the trumpet bid the candidates
with confidence appear and urge their claims
illustrious monarch emp'ror of the isles
my name is guzman from those heroes sprung
who with pelagio 'mid th' asturian rocks
against th' invasion of unnumber'd moors
maintain'd the same and empire of the goths
and founded at oviedo once again
the spanish monarchy and cath'lick faith
transporting from the mountain's dreary womb
to glitt'ring temples her most holy altars
thence on the bordering moor their valiant sons
waging incessant war ere long regain'd
their ancient realms of leon arragon
and rich castilia in which great exploits
my brave progenitors by valour zeal
and loyalty distinguish'd from their kings
gain'd those high honours princely signories
and proud prerogatives which have extoll'd
the name of guzman to such envy'd grandeur
that scarce above it towers the regal throne
these honours undiminish'd undefil'd
to me deliver'd down might well content
a vulgar mind but spirits highly born
are full of gen'rous and aspiring thoughts
and use the vantage ground of rank and pow'r
but to ascend still higher thus i come
thy garter to sollicit pleas'd great prince
with thee to be enroll'd thy brother knight
and fearing no repulse nobility
as nearest in her orbit first receives
the beams of majesty alone can bear
the fulness of that glory which o'erpow'rs
inferior natures virtue's self would blush
did she at once approach too near the throne
but the young eagle borne amid the blaze
of glancing lightnings with undazzled eye
soars to the courts of heav'n and perches bold
on the bright sceptre of imperial jove
the greatest king is he who is the king
of greatest subjects seek'st thou to advance
the glory of thy order to thy self
associate those whose highexalted names
for ages past from envy's self have forc'd
habitual veneration never paid
to new and upstart merit such am i
whose pure and gen'rous blood descending down
from noblest fountains in its course enrich'd
by glorious mixtures with each royal stream
that fair iberia boasts might ev'n pretend
to thy alliance edward view this scroll
the faithful blazon of my ancient line
a line of potentates whose ev'ry son
deserv'd to wear the garter i demand
in me their representative the heir
of all their honours son of their renown
do thou reward their virtues in their names
i claim and on hereditary right
the right of monarchs edward rest my plea
the high desert of thy renown'd forefathers
well hast thou shewn but hast thou therefore prov'd
thy self deserving to be call'd their son
to thee their prosp'rous virtues have indeed
transmitted lineal rank and titles proud
by them more hardly gain'd for which thou stand'st
to custom and th' indulgence of thy country
indebted guzman in a large account
which thou must first discharge by noble deeds
ere thou canst stile those dignities thine own
this if thou hast not paid why dost thou seek
like thriftless prodigals to swell the debt
and overwhelm thy self with obligations
virtue is honour and the noblest titles
are but the public stamps set on the ore
to ascertain its value to mankind
it were a kind of treason to my crown
to mark base metal with the royal impress
and put off lazy pride in virtue's name
wou'dst thou attain my garter seek it there
where thy heroic ancestors acquir'd
their glorious honours in th' embattled field
among the squadrons of the warlike moors
or in the council of thy king by truth
and wisdom equal to th' important trust
be what thy fathers were and then return
to ask the pledge of merit from my hand
and be the fit companion of a king
from genoa the opulent the bank
and treasury of the world most puissant king
invited by thy heralds am i come
to claim the honour by thy promise due
due by thy justice to superior worth
due then to me great edward who possess
that object of the toils the cares the vows
of all mankind that comprehensive good
source of all pow'r and grandeur boundless wealth
behold yon glitt'ring train whose sumptuous pride
bright with the treasures of each precious mine
invests with glory thy imperial throne
whence is their dignity the ray august
that awes and dazzles the respectful crowd
proceeds it from nobility from virtue
their wisdom or their valour or their fame
comes it not rather from the beaming ore
the diamond's starlike radiance wealth o king
wealth is the sun that decks the gorgeous scene
that cherishes adorns and calls to view
these princely flowers of honour virtue fame
which in the shades of poverty were lost
whatever men desire or venerate
on wealth attends ev'n empire's self is bought
nor cou'd the mighty julius have attain'd
by wisdom or by valour sov'reign pow'r
had not the gold of vanquish'd gaul subdu'd
the liberties of rome on wretched want
contempt and narrowsoul'd dependence wait
ev'n kings of necessary wealth depriv'd
in powerless indigence lose all respect
all homage from their subjects while the rich
like gods ador'd o'er ev'ry neck extend
their potent sceptres and in golden chains
fierce faction and rebellious freedom bind
the glory strength importance of a realm
is measur'd by its riches venice thus
thus genoa's petty state outbalances
in europe's scale the boundless wilds that cloath
with tributary furs the russian czar
with like preeminence exalted shines
in ev'ry land above the proudest names
the blest possessor of allworship'd gold
my birth or rank i boast not here though born
a senator of genoa the desert
on which i found my claim is all my own
to have adorn'd and dignify'd the state
of my declining house with greater wealth
than e'er my thriftless ancestors possess'd
whose richest acquisitions were but sprigs
of barren laurel or the flaunting rags
of some torn ensign to their needy son
a worthless heritage yet not to swell
my narrow fortunes wou'd my soul descend
to the base methods of ignoble trade
and vulgar mercantile pursuit of gain
mine were the noble arts of raising gold
from gold of nursing and improving wealth
by gainful use arts practis'd heretofore
by senators and sages of old rome
illustrious crassus and wise seneca
thus have i grac'd the splendor of my name
with suitable possessions thus i hold
in firm subjection to my will the poor
of ev'ry rank and order soldier priest
the vent'rous merchant and the sumptuous lord
who in a lower vassalage to me
than to thy sceptre edward bow their heads
pledging their lands and liberties for gold
hence am i bold to stand before thy throne
a candidate for glory's highest prize
and let me add that policy alone
shou'd teach thy prudence to approve my claim
shou'd teach thee in thy subjects to excite
by honours on superior wealth bestow'd
an useful emulation to be rich
which once inspir'd thy albion shall become
the first of nations thou the first of kings
hadst thou by op'ning to thy native land
the golden veins of commerce by employing
the useful hands of industry in works
of national advantage by uniting
remotest regions in the friendly bands
and honest intercourse of mutual trade
hadst thou by these humane and generous arts
which thy mistaken pride so much disdains
enrich'd at once thy country and thy self
then not unworthy hadst thou been to wear
the brightest marks of honour but thy wealth
the baseborn child of sordid usury
that foe to commerce nurse of idleness
stains and degrades thee from thy noble birth
nor in the usurer can i discern
the senator of genoa to enlarge
the mind with gen'rous sentiments to raise
its aims by virtuous emulation here
i sit but not to gild with honour's beams
that selfish passion which congeals the heart
and stops the streams of sweet benevolence
mean avarice the vice of narrowest souls
incapable of glory wealth thou say'st
can buy ev'n empire and to julius gave
dominion o'er his country fatal gift
and ruinous to both but what to rome
what to that caesar's successors avail'd
the boundless treasures of the ravag'd world
when they had lost their virtue did not soon
the valiant sons of poverty the goths
the huns and vandals from their barren hills
and rugged woods descending to their steel
subject the roman gold yet i deny not
the pow'r and use of riches to the wise
and good in publick or in private life
they are the means of virtue and best serve
the noblest purposes but in the use
not in the bare possession lies the merit
shew me thy merit then thy bounteous acts
publick munificence or private alms
the hungry and the naked and the sick
sustain'd and cherish'd by thy saving hand
plead this and i allow thy worthy claim
for this is virtue and deserves reward
not on my wealth nor on my noble blood
shall i presume to claim thy royal gift
auspicious prince but on the skill to give
that splendor to nobility and wealth
that elegance of taste from which alone
their value they derive of this to judge
this to direct i boast fit arbiter
of all refin'd delights but chief to kings
my happy talents i devote on them
my genius waits with duteous care and wafts
the golden cup of pleasure to their lips
like ganymede before the throne of jove
and who indeed would wish to be a god
only to thunder and to hear the pray'rs
of clam'rous suitors 'tis the nectar'd feast
the dance of graces and the wanton charms
of venus sporting with the smiles and loves
that make the court of heav'n a blest abode
far happier were the meanest peasant's lot
who sleeps or sings in careless ease beneath
the sunburnt haycock or the flow'ry thorn
than to be plac'd on high in anxious pride
the purple drudge and slave of tiresome state
if to superior pow'r superior means
of joy were not annex'd and larger scope
for ev'ry wish the lavish heart can form
if the soft hand of pleasure did not wreathe
around the royal diadem whose weight
oppressive loads the monarch's aching brow
her fairest growth of everblooming flow'rs
on thee victorious prince propitious fortune
hath pour'd her richest gifts renown and wealth
and greatness equal to thy mighty mind
one only bliss is wanting to thy court
voluptuous elegance the lovely child
of ease and opulence that never comes
but like a bird of summer to attend
the brightest sunshine of a glorious state
to her and her alone belongs the task
by learned delicacy to remove
what yet remains in this thy ancient realm
of gothick barbarism the rust of war
and valiant ignorance her artful hand
thy rugged britons shall refine and teach
more courtly manners to their sov'reign's will
politely pliant do but thou command
thy willing servant with thy favours grac'd
from fair joanna's eversmiling court
under whose happy influence i was train'd
from polish'd naples her delightful seat
the blooming goddess to transport with all
her train of joys and fix them here beneath
thy great protection but perhaps thou fear'st
the voice of censure and the grave reproof
of moralizing dullness idle fear
the vulgar herd indeed religious craft
and policy of state have well confin'd
with wise severity to rigid laws
else would that headstrong beast the multitude
forget obedience and its rider's voice
disdain but shall the rider put a curb
in his own mouth the laws that kings have made
shall they restrain the makers edward no
for thee indulgent justice shall relax
her harsh decrees and piety shall wait
to give her rev'rend sanction to thy will
'tis thine to rove at large thro' nature's field
crop ev'ry flow'r and taste of ev'ry fruit
by sweet variety provoking still
the languid appetite to new desires
nor useless to thy pleasures happy prince
shall be my faithful service nicer joys
joys of a quicker more exalted taste
than ever ripen'd in this northern clime
the growth of softer regions shall my hand
by skilful culture in thy britain raise
to them whose gross and dull capacities
are fit to bear the burthens of the state
the lab'ring mules that thro' the mire of forms
draw the slow car of government along
gladly the task of bus'ness i resign
be mine the brighter province to direct
thy pleasures edward minister supreme
of all thy softer hours to serve the king
be theirs the glory let me serve the man
but shou'd thy sterner genius only pleas'd
with arms and royalty's important cares
the duties of a king my gentle arts
too lightly prize and thence reject my suit
permit at least that to philippa's ear
divine philippa thine and beauty's queen
and her attendant graces i may plead
the cause of bliss a cause so much their own
they will approve my claim to whom the cares
the labours of my life my head my heart
are all devoted let me from their hands
receive the garter and be call'd their knight
permit me gracious edward to reply
to this irreverent flatt'rer who presumes
before a matron and a queen to plead
the cause of vice and impudently hopes
to find in her a fautress of his suit
but know pernicious sophister my heart
hath learn'd from edward's love and this high rank
which i partake with him a noble pride
that ill can brook the too familiar eye
and saucy tongue of riot and debauch
in whose unmanner'd light society
nor majesty nor virtue can maintain
that dignity which is their proper guard
thy vile refinements and luxurious arts
miscall'd politeness i detest and feel
in the soft duties of a virtuous love
such pure serene delight as far transcends
what thou styl'st pleasure the delirious joy
of an intoxicated feverish brain
behold my royal lord the first and best
of kings the love and wonder of mankind
behold my children worthy their great sire
the gen'ral theme of praise and benediction
these are my pleasures can thy skill bestow
superior bliss ah no the vain attempt
wou'd only bring disgust remorse and shame
that i have lov'd philippa and esteem'd thee
more for thy virtues than those female charms
which this vile flatterer deems singly worth
his panegyrick be thy happiness
and glory as it is thy edward's pride
with the like spirit have i also woo'd
and wedded sov'reign power nor weakly caught
with outward pomp or seeking to myself
a privilege to riot uncontroul'd
in sensual pleasures and behind the throne
to laugh securely at restraint and law
no i embrac'd her as the child of heav'n
dowr'd with the ample means of doing good
from whose espousals i might hope to raise
an offspring worth th' ambition of a king
immortal glory to a gen'rous mind
as far surpassing all the wanton toys
which he calls pleasure as thy faithful love
the sweet o'erflowing of heartfelt delight
excels philippa the lascivious smile
of common prostitutes caress'd and loath'd
hence from my sight with thy detested arts
base minister of luxury the bane
of ev'ry flourishing and happy state
presume no more within my court to sing
thy syrensong nor soften into slaves
and cowards my brave subjects i disdain
that elegance which such as thou can teach
virtue alone is elegant alone
polite vice must be sordid and deform'd
tho' to adorn her ev'ry art contend
and rather wou'd i see my britons roam
untutor'd savages among the woods
as once they did in naked innocence
than polish'd like the vile degenerate race
of modern italy's corrupted sons
nor riches nor nobility of birth
nor the soft arts of base effem'nate ease
which justly thou rejectest valiant prince
but thy own darling attribute i boast
undaunted courage try'd in many a field
in ev'ry clime and under ev'ry banner
that for these forty summers have been wav'd
o'er europe's plains by ister rhine and po
hungarian and bohemian flemish french
venetian spanish guelph and gibbeline
whence in just confidence secure i come
this military honour to demand
due to my toils and service to my wounds
my laurels and that generous love of glory
which without any call or publick cause
or private animosity alone
rais'd my strong arm and drew my dreadful sword
wherever mars his crimson flag display'd
that was my country thither swift i bore
my ready valour and the dauntless band
of various nations under my command
prepar'd to sell their blood their limbs their lives
nor where the right nor where the justest cause
deign'd we to ask those intricate debates
we left to lazy penmen in the shade
of coward ease while our impetuous fire
still bore us forward ardent to pursue
thro' danger's roughest paths the steps to fame
on such a spirit should thy favour smile
but let me wonder edward that so long
thy ear the vain pretensions cou'd endure
of men unknown to war attendants meet
of some luxurious asiatic court
or female distaffreign but suiting ill
the presence of a monarch great in arms
hadst thou to those inglorious sons of peace
thy martial order giv'n the warriorsaint
had blush'd to see his image so profan'd
which on my manly breast indented o'er
with many a noble scar will fitly shine
but wherefore stand i thus haranguing here
unskilful as i am in smooth discourse
the coward's argument on force alone
i rest my title let the glorious prize
be hung on high amid the listed field
and let me there dispute it there my lance
shall plead my cause far better than my tongue
if any dare deny my rightful claim
not for the brave alone have i ordain'd
this institution but for all desert
all publick virtue wisdom all that serves
improves defends or dignifies a state
tho' first indeed to valour as the guard
of all the rest when in the publick cause
with justice and benevolence employ'd
but thou base mercenary canst thou dare
the glorious name of valour to usurp
who know'st no publick cause no sense of right
nor pity nor affection nor remorse
who under any chief in any quarrel
canst stain with gore thy prostituted arms
call it not love of glory that is built
on acts for the deliv'rance of mankind
on gen'rous principles and noble scorn
of sordid int'rest call it cruel pride
and savageness of nature that delights
to conquer and oppress afflict insult
or call it love of plunder that can draw
unauthoris'd uninjur'd unprovok'd
the sword of war that bravolike can lift
for hire the venal hand to perpetrate
assassinations murders massacres
but thou hast serv'd with courage be it so
thou hast thy pay and with it thy reward
pretend no farther nor compare thy deeds
dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain
with his who for his country and his king
resigns his ease his fortune or his life
those battles thou hast fought those forty years
of blood and horror which thy vaunting tongue
so high hath sounded are indeed thy crimes
flagitious crimes for which th' impartial bar
of reason wou'd condemn thee as the foe
of human nature did not custom screen
by her unjust esteem thy guilty head
but hope not honour or employment here
unsafe and wretched is that monarch's state
who weakly trusts to mercenary bands
the guard or of his person or his realm
unfaithful insolent rapacious base
he soon shall prove them and become himself
their slave to hold his kingdom at their will
for this within my britain have i sought
to raise a martial spirit and ordain'd
these new incitements honours and rewards
to virtuous chivalry that never king
who wears hereafter my imperial crown
may need to stoop to the precarious aid
of venal foreign swords but in the hearts
of his brave subjects find a stronger guard
prepar'd with zeal unbought and english valour
his rights to vindicate and save their own
well has thy sovereign wisdom royal judge
the suit refus'd of these pretenders vain
and by rejecting them embolden'd me
for valour and nobility and wealth
though by their proud possessors vaunted high
are but subordinate the slaves and tools
not the companions and the counsellors
of godlike monarchy whose aweful throne
by darksome clouds envelop'd far beyond
the ken of vulgar eyes supported stands
on that deeprooted prop the craft of state
mysterious policy who best hath learn'd
her wily lessons best deserves to share
the honours counsels and the hearts of kings
by him instructed ev'n the meanest prince
shall rise to envy'd greatness shall advance
his dreaded pow'r above restraint and fear
and all the rules that in fantastic chains
inferior minds confine thus milan's dukes
thus padua's lords above their country's laws
have rais'd their heads and trampled to the dust
the pride of freedom that essays in vain
their high superior genius to controul
these were my masters mighty prince beneath
their rule and in their councils was i form'd
to know the false corrupted heart of man
his ev'ry weakness ev'ry vice and thence
to tempt or break his passions to the yoke
to scorn the publick as an empty name
and on the helpless multitude impose
the adamantine bonds of fraud and force
thus was i train'd thus fitted to conduct
the fate of proudest empires thus i come
to claim thy garter edward the just meed
of worth praeeminent and in return
my services to offer which no doubt
thy wisdom gladly will accept for who
so fit to serve the majesty of kings
as he who slighting ev'ry meaner tye
friends parents country to advance their pow'r
devotes his toil experience fortune fame
nor other favour courts nor refuge hopes
but in their high protection led by me
thou royal edward shalt attain that height
that glorious summit of imperial pow'r
which not thy mighty ancestors have reach'd
where in a freer air a more enlarg'd
horizon bounded only by thy will
thou shalt exalted sit and view beneath
in humbler distances and safer bounds
those subjects who presumptuous now approach
too near and with rude hands profane thy throne
nor let weak scruples check thy manly soul
in the bright task of glory know great prince
a king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r
the only god before whose shrine the wise
their incense offer whence inspir'd they draw
divine ambition and heroic scorn
of vulgar prejudices vulgar fears
virtue's the people's idol and by them
rewarded well with popular applause
that idle breath the gift and prize of fools
'tis thine to govern not to court mankind
nor on their smiles precarious to depend
but nobly force them to depend on thine
o sacred sir can virtue give thee this
this bright supremacy trust not her boasts
her idle pageanty of barren praise
reject her saucy claims importunate
and selfsupported nor admit her train
proud independency and publick zeal
those factious demagogues the foes of kings
are virtue then and love of publick good
the foes of monarchy and are deceit
injustice and oppression qualities
becoming and expedient in a king
then know i not to govern but have nurs'd
for twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart
a pois'nous viper nay unking'd myself
by yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'r
with laws and charters of enfranchisement
not due it seems from monarchs to their slaves
but know vile counsellor of infamy
that i disdain thy politics those false
and shallow politics by which my sire
weak judging edward was betray'd to shame
and foul destruction while to such as thee
his ear and heart incautious he resign'd
and was indeed their slave not england's king
by maxims different far have i sustain'd
the strength and splendor of my regal state
on the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd
with solid firmness by encouraging
the gen'rous love of virtue and of fame
that source of valour pledge of victory
by granting to my subjects what indeed
is their inherent right security
the cheerful father of content and peace
of industry and opulence which fills
with smiling multitudes the land and pays
in willing subsidies that prince's care
who lays up treasure in his people's hearts
by holding with a firm impartial hand
the sleddy scale of justice not alone
betwixt my subjects in their private rights
but in the gen'ral more important cause
betwixt the crown and them the diff'rent claims
of freedom and of just prerogative
transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r
nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws
that in their golden chain together bind
for common good the whole united state
but more than all by guarding from contempt
or impious violation that supreme
protrectress of all government and law
religion in whose train for ever wait
obedience order justice mercy love
a guard of angels plac'd around the throne
her sacred counsels have i still rever'd
her high commands enforc'd her pow'r implor'd
o'er all my subject nations to call down
from heav'nly wisdom her eternal fire
a fix'd secure felicity beyond
the force of human prudence to attain
these are my arts of government those arts
by which my british crown i have advanc'd
above th' imperial diadem above
the pride of afric's or of asia's thrones
i wou'd not tell thee this but that thou seem'st
a stranger to my fame as to my realm
and to the real greatness of a king
whose sacred dignity by thee traduc'd
much it behoves a king to vindicate
not by rejecting only with disdain
thy arrogant pretensions but in thee
dishonouring and branding with reproach
thy tenets also the pernicious lore
of tyrants and usurpers which thy tongue
blaspheming justice government and law
hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent
hence from my kingdom with thy quickest speed
lest the revenge of an insulted king
with sudden ruin intercept thy flight
permit me edward to thy royal voice
to add my suffrage also and with thee
protest against this coward policy
that meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud
and low unprincely artifice i feel
a virtue in my heart a gen'rous pride
that tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty
encircled with authority rever'd
and almost deify'd to teach them thence
that goodness and the saving attributes
of heav'n become their office justice chief
and truth the virtue of heroic minds
which were it banish'd from all other breasts
should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings
behold in us great king the ancient priests
and judges of this land the druids old
who late in borrow'd characters have stood
before thy sage tribunal to prefer
the claims of valour wealth nobility
and those soft specious flatt'rers who beneath
the rosy wreath of pleasure and of love
conceal the sickly and disgustful brow
of riot and debauch and often win
from weak unmanly princes the rich prize
to virtue due and wisdom not to these
the cankers of a state but least of all
due to that traytor of his king and country
who lab'ring to build up the regal throne
beyond its due proportion and the strength
of those foundations which the laws have laid
o'erwhelms the people and at once o'erturns
his royal master places him at best
on an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle
the mark of execration and reproach
these claims hast thou rejected like a king
discerning in mankind and knowing well
the value of his favours like a king
deserving the high office of the judge
and arbiter of europe like a king
equal to his great fame and worth the care
of those immortal spirits who this day
have quitted their celestial residence
to view and to approve thy glorious deeds
but edward be not thou amaz'd to find
that those who lately for thy favour su'd
were not the personages they assum'd
o king thou art beset with counterfeits
the very opposites to us who seem
far better than they are for flattery
cameleonlike accommodates with care
to the courthue his changeful countenance
and when a prince is brave magnanimous
and high in spirit then ambition wears
a face of dignity and nothing breathes
but lofty enterprizes conquest pow'r
and schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear
pretending love and care for his renown
with more than duteous zeal of these beware
for as the theban queen in fables old
was by the specious guile of fraudful jove
in her amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd
so by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd
ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shapes
to take a traytor to their royal arms
but thou shalt know them edward by their works
and of this truth be most assur'd that he
who in his private commerce with mankind
is mean dishonest interested false
can ne'er be true to thee nor can he love
his prince who feels not for his country's good
thus warn'd we leave thee mighty prince be firm
be constant in the paths of fair renown
think it thy duty to revere thyself
the sacred laws of chivalry the wise
injunctions by thy order laid on all
the garter'd knights so shall thy fame remain
the great example of all future kings
farewell for lo the genius of thy realm
with all his pomp attended comes to share
and grace the glories of this signal day
these clouds of fragrance that farbeaming blaze
of heav'nly brightness his approach declare
from the gay realms of cloudless day i come
where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds
that like to isles of various magnitudes
float in the ocean of unbounded space
on my invisible arial throne
i sit attended with a radiant band
of spirits immortal whose pure essences
while clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt
thro' the dull clay of gross mortality
disclos'd their heav'nly vigour and burst forth
in godlike virtues and heroic deeds
their albion gracing with as fair a growth
of fame as e'er enrich'd imperial rome
thence ripe for heav'n and immortality
to me the genius of this happy isle
they fly and claim the meed of their desert
celestial crowns and everliving praise
recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards
that round my throne their hymns of triumph sing
attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres
their undiscording lyres and voice divine
nor thus remov'd to heav'n and thus employ'd
in careless raptures wont they to forget
their native country and the public weal
to which on earth their labours and their lives
they once devoted but pursuing still
the bent and habit of their souls with me
they watch the british empire still intent
to check alternately th' incroaching waves
of regal pow'r and popular liberty
i chief attentive near the royal throne
take up my watchful station to infuse
my sage and mod'rate counsels in those ears
which wisdom hath prepar'd and purify'd
to relish honest tho' unpleasing truth
thus am i always tho' invisible
attendant edward on thy glorious deeds
but on this solemn day have i vouchsaf'd
to manifest my presence to declare
not in those whispers which have often spoke
peace to thy conscious heart but audibly
and evident to all th' assent of heav'n
to the great business which hath gather'd here
this troop of princes from all nations round
hence all may know that virtue hath a train
more bright than earthly empire can command
know that those actions which are great and good
receive a nobler sanction from the free
and universal voice of all mankind
which is the voice of heav'n than from the highest
the most illustrious act of regal pow'r
this nobler sanction edward in the name
not of this age alone but latest time
here do i solemnly annex to each
of thy great acts but chief to this most wise
most virtuous institution which extends
wide as thy fame beyond thy empire's bound
a prize of virtue publish'd to mankind
ye registers of heav'n record the deed
now tune ye bards the british lyre
now wake the vocal string
while heav'n and earth in edward's praise conspire
join to the gen'ral voice your sacred choir
and on your soaring wing
from time and envy waft his glorious name
and place it in the shrine of incorruptive fame
begin the list'ning echoes round
shall catch with joy the longforgotten sound
and warbling thro' each grove the british strain
to windsor's smiling nymphs recall their arthur's reign
ye nymphs of windsor's bow'ry woods
ye pow'rs who haunt yon glist'ning floods
that with reluctant fond delay
around yon flow'ry valley stray
say from your minds hath time eras'd
the pleasing images of glory pass'd
review ye now those scenes no more
when nobly stain'd with saxon gore
from badon's longcontended plain
great arthur with his martial train
to windsor's chosen shades repair'd
and with his knights the festive banquet shar'd
then first exulting thames beheld
the triumphs of the listed field
beheld along his level meads
careering knights encount'ring steeds
heroic games whose toils inspire
the thirst of praise and kindle martial fire
fair peace in war's bright mail array'd
with smiles the glorious lists survey'd
so shou'd the brave she cry'd prepare
their hearts and sinewy arms for war
such combats break not my repose
such sons best guard my rights from daring foes
then too in feastful hall or bow'r
attendant on the genial hour
the british harp sweet lyrists strung
and albion's generous victors sung
while valiant arthur's copious fame
incessant fed the bright poetic flame
but mortals erring in excess
o'erwhelm the virtue they caress
thus arthur his great story mourn'd
by too fond praise to fable turn'd
mourn'd the companions of his toils
mock'd with false glory and fantastic spoils
'till thro' the dark romantic tale
thro' superstition's magic veil
sage edward piercing view'd and own'd
the chief with genuine lustre crown'd
view'd the great model and restor'd
the longlost honours of his martial board
hail british prince these faithful lays
eternal records of heroic worth
shall reassert thy ancient praise
and from the cloud of fiction call thee forth
in glory's sphere thy orbit to reclaim
and at great edward's beam relume thy darken'd fame
but see in heav'nly panoply array'd
whose streaming radiance skirts the clouds with gold
i view pendragon burst the veiling shade
and all his blazing magnitude unfold
o'er yon broad tow'r he takes his airy stand
and pointing edward towards the royal throne
to his fam'd knights around a laurel'd band
shews on thy knee the bright skytinctur'd zone
virtue he cries th' aetherial sound
thy gross material organ cannot hear
virtue on earth by british edward crown'd
her rev'rend throne once more shall rear
to her own selfapplauding breast
forc'd for reward no longer to retreat
she sees her aweful charms by kings caress'd
sees honour woo her for his mate
honour her heav'nelected spouse
from her embrace by lawless pow'r withheld
now at yon altar plights his holy vows
vows by assenting edward seal'd
and now the fair angelic bride
gath'ring her noble train from ev'ry land
to her late wedded lord with decent pride
presents the venerable band
the great procession edward leads
i see yon hallow'd dome with heroes throng'd
incessant still the whiteplum'd pomp proceeds
thro' time's eternal course prolong'd
and you dear partners of my fame
your ancient honours now again shall boast
this noble order shall retrieve our name
in visionary fables lost
this from our martial board deriv'd
these for our brethren let us proudly own
more pleas'd to view our deeds by thee reviv'd
then griev'd great king to be outdone
nor thee o windsor shall i pass unsung
mansion of princes and fit haunt of gods
who frequent shall desert their bright abodes
to view thy sacred walls with trophies hung
thy walls by british arthur first renown'd
the early seat of chivalry and fame
by edward now with deathless honours crown'd
illustrious by his birth his garter and his name
conferring just rewards most worthy prince
is the first attribute of sov'reign pow'r
and that which best distinguishes a king
for punishment and all the nice awards
of civil justice by the laws are fix'd
and kings but execute what they decree
while in rewarding merit uncontroul'd
unguided unassisted is the hand
of majesty the prince himself alone
there judges and his wisdom is the law
well does thy court great king with ev'ry worth
and ev'ry virtue fill'd this wisdom shew
in thee transcendent well hast thou approv'd
its force in this great trial which my pow'r
commanded in no common ways to prove
thy royal mind but that a father's name
may not restrain thy justice in the choice
of the first knightscompanions of st george
myself here take upon me to present
a candidate whom were he not thy son
thou wouldst thyself select from all mankind
his modesty compels me to declare
that candidate is edward prince of wales
inhabitant of heav'n i not presume
to deprecate or question that high will
to which it best becomes me to submit
but gentle spirit be propitious to me
and thou my gracious liege if i request
that this illustrious monarch whose desert
is equal to the grandeur of his crown
may stand before me in this list of fame
o generous youth in vain thy goodness strives
to raise thy captive thus above his fortune
the king that is not free is not a king
nor can thy bounteous favour reconcile
honour and bondage to thy conqu'ring son
do thou great edward give this noble mark
of prosp'rous virtue ill becomes it me
to wear at once thy garter and thy chains
though by my former dignity i swear
that were i reinstated in my throne
the thronc of capet and of charlemagne
thus to be join'd in fellowship with thee
would be the first ambition of my soul
a ray of glory i would sue to gain
and prize it equal with my diadem
wisely thou hast determin'd worthy prince
for thine and edward's honour and hast fix'd
its proper value on his royal gift
which as the meed of merit may become
the proudest monarchs by this garter mark'd
for something more than monarchs virtuous men
this be the glory of thy order edward
and never shall it want the greatest names
of all succeeding times to grace its annals
france sweden poland germany and spain
each realm of europe's wideextended bounds
shall count among thy knights its mightiest lords
and see in emulation of thy fame
new royal founders of like orders rise
proceed then mighty king and set the world
the precedent of glory thou begin
the radiant list of sov'reigns while thy son
like a young bride that on her nuptial morn
leads on with modest pride the virginchoir
herself the brightest heads the shining band
of knightscompanions nobly seconding
his father's glorious deeds with equal fame
the testimony of heav'n to thee my son
thus gloriously accorded renders vain
all farther trial to my people's voice
by this their tutelary pow'r declar'd
with pleasure i consent directing still
by theirs my choice my judgment my desires
approach then my belov'd my noble son
strength of my crown and honour of my realm
in whom my heart more joys and glories more
than in the highest pride of sov'reign pow'r
thus i admit thee edward prince of wales
first founder of the order of st george
in evidence whereof about thy knee
i bind this mystic garter to denote
the bond of honour that together ties
the brethren of st george in friendly league
united to maintain the cause of truth
and justice only may propitious heav'n
grant thou may'st henceforth wear it to his praise
the exaltation of this noble order
and thy own glory with like reverence
my son receive and wear this golden chain
grac'd with the image of britannia's saint
heav'n's valiant soldier cappadocian george
in imitation of whose glorious deeds
may'st thou triumphant in each state of life
or prosperous or adverse still subdue
thy spiritual and carnal enemies
that not on earth alone thou may'st obtain
the guerdon of thy valour endless praise
but with the virtuous and the brave above
in solemn triumph wear celestial palms
to crown thy final noblest victory
accept my sovereign liege my grateful thanks
that thou hast thus vouchsaf'd to place thy son
first next thyself upon the roll of fame
as he indeed is first in filial love
and emulation of thy royal virtues
and may thy benediction gracious lord
may thy paternal vows be heard in heav'n
that he whom thou hast listed in the cause
of truth and virtue never may forget
his vow'd engagements nor defraud thy hopes
by soiling with dishonourable deeds
the lustre of that order which thy name
shou'd teach him to respect and to adorn
celestial maid
bright spark of that aetherial flame
whose vivid spirit thro' all nature spread
sustains and actuates this boundless frame
o by whatever stile to mortals known
virtue benevolence or public zeal
divine assessor of the regal throne
divine protectress of the common weal
o in our hearts thy energy infuse
be thou our muse
and as of old impart thy heav'nly aid
to those who warm'd by thy benignant fire
to public merit and their country's good
devoted ever their recording lyre
wont along deva's sacred flood
or beneath mona's oak retir'd
to warble forth their patriot lays
and nourish with immortal praise
the bright heroic flames by thee inspir'd
i feel i feel
thy soulinvigorating heat
my bounding veins distend with fervent zeal
and to britannia's fame responsive beat
hail albion native country but how chang'd
thy once grim aspect how adorn'd and gay
thy howling forests where together rang'd
the naked hunter and his savage prey
where amid black inhospitable woods
the sedgegrown floods
all cheerless stray'd
not in their lonely wand'ring course survey'd
or tow'r or castle heav'nascending fane
or lowly village residence of peace
and joyous industry or furrow'd plain
or lowing herd or silver fleece
that whitens now each verdant vale
while laden with their precious store
far trading barks to every shore
swift heralds of britannia's glory sail
these are thy shining works this smiling face
of beauteous nature thus in regal state
deck'd by each handmaid art each polish'd grace
that on fair liberty and order wait
this pomp these riches this repose
to thee imperial britain owes
to thee great substitute of heav'n
to whom the charge of earthly realms was giv'n
their social systems by wise nature's plan
to form and rule by her eternal laws
to teach the selfish soul of wayward man
to seek the publick good and aid the common cause
so didst thou move the mighty heart
of alfred founder of the british state
so to matilda's scepter'd son
to him whose virtue and renown
first made the name of edward great
thy ample spirit so didst thou impart
protecting thus in every age
from greedy pow'r and factious rage
the law of freedom which to britain's shore
from saxon elva's manyheaded flood
the valiant sons of odin with them bore
their national ador'd inseparable good
on yonder plain
along whose willowfringed side
the silverfooted naiads sportive train
down the smooth thames amid the cygnets glide
i saw when at thy reconciling word
injustice anarchy intestine jar
despotick insolence the wasting sword
and all the brazen throats of civil war
were hush'd in peace from his imperious throne
hurl'd furious down
abash'd dismay'd
like a chas'd lion to the savage shade
of his own forests fell oppression fled
with vengeance brooding in his sullen breast
then justice fearless rear'd her decent head
heal'd every grief each wrong redress'd
while round her valiant squadrons stood
and bade her aweful tongue demand
from vanquish'd john's reluctant hand
the deed of freedom purchas'd with their blood
o vain surmise
to deem the grandeur of a crown
consists in lawless pow'r to deem them wife
who change security and fair renown
for detestation shame distrust and fear
who shut for ever from the blissful bow'rs
with horror and remorse at distance hear
the musick that inchants th' immortal pow'rs
the heav'nly musick of wellpurchas'd praise
seraphick lays
the sweet reward
on heroes patriots righteous kings conferr'd
for such alone the heav'ntaught poets sing
tune ye for edward then the mortal strain
his name shall well become your golden string
begirt with this aetherial train
seems he not rank'd among the gods
then let him reap the glorious meed
due to each great heroic deed
and taste the pleasures of the blest abodes
hail happy prince on whom kind fate bestows
sublimer joys and glory brighter far
than cressy's palm and every wreath that grows
in all the bloodstain'd field of prosp'rous war
joys that might charm an heav'nly breast
to make dependent millions blest
a dying nation to restore
and save fall'n liberty with kingly pow'r
to quench the torch of discord and debate
relume the languid spark of publick zeal
repair the breaches of a shatter'd state
and gloriously compleat the plan of england's weal
compleat the noble gothick pile
that on the rock of justice rear'd shall stand
in symmetry and strength and fame
a rival of that boasted frame
which virtue rais'd on tiber's strand
this edward guardian father of our isle
this godlike task to few assign'd
exalts thee above humankind
and from the realms of everlasting day
calls down celestial bards thy praise to sing
calls this bright troop of spirits to survey
thee the great miracle of earth a patriotking
now reascend your skies immortal spirits
th' important act that drew ye down to earth
is finish'd spare we now their mortal sense
that cannot long endure th' unshrouded beam
of higher natures well hath edward laid
under your happy auspices the base
of his great order let him undisturb'd
but not unaided by the heav'nly powers
compleat th' illustrious work which future kings
struck with the beauty of the noble plan
shall emulously labour to maintain
and may thy spirit edward be their guide
in every chapter thou henceforth preside
in every breast infuse thy virtuous flame
and teach them to respect their country's fame
when i heard you were landed i flew to the nine
intreating their aid to invite you to dine
they told me i came on that errand too late
for you were engag'd by the rich and the great
already said i they were speedy indeed
however i'll try and i hope to succeed
those creatures of power who your levee attend
if your father were out their conge's would end
tho' your personal merit is great 'tis allow'd
'tis the son of the statesman that weighs with the croud
i expect not a place nor hope for a pension
the love of the muse is my only pretension
i hate to abuse and i never can flatter
i write for no party nor either bespatter
from the lands of parnassus the rents are illpaid
and england has cruelly cramp'd us in trade
so look not for china or service of plate
or ought that is costly to tempt you to eat
yet a way to engage you i think i have hit on
i mean to remember our friends in greatbritain
two bottles of wine and two dishes i'll give
then fly from the crouds that oppress you and live
the first glass shall welcome you sir to our coast
and dear lady conway shall be my next toast
with mirth and good humour i'll make up the treat
i know you're too wise to love dining in state
though low is my cot and the scene all around
yet here even here it is thought may be found
when aurora walks forth and collects her perfume
her eye can look down just as fond to illume
all nature beholding she smiles as she sees
as she looks at the lustre that darts through the trees
if such things to observe while beneath the dark oak
bid them haste while the dryads the songsters invoke
for as yet the rude catch from the briar may be borne
since we yet can remember the harsh wounding thorn
but soon yellow autumn the green leaves shall stain
though now whetting scythes the gay season proclaim
yet nature still changing that season shall bring
when the gadding gay woodbine no longer shall cling
with you i must own should the glow of the plain
though fond of the scene i no more would complain
and without them how oft have i sigh'd as i view'd
thy regrets silly heart were too fondly renew'd
what joy would i say can these beauties bestow
though nature shed incense wherever i go
for ah i have found in the bosom alone
if we make not this cellliving goddess our own
for fancy that fairy will darken the glade
will heighten or lessen the falling cascade
yet still there's a nymph with as magical powers
and she even she can hand round the dull hours
what though she is rural and best loves the grove
yet not to one spot does she fasten her love
she rambles about and i meet her at eve
at noon in the shade help her chaplets to weave
to such favour i've got that my friends she will guide
that they shall not be weary when set by my side
deck'd with rays of purple light
hither cupid wing thy flight
through the pure unclouded sky
let thy shafts unnumber'd fly
bid the warblers of the grove
bow before the shrine of love
and with thy resistless dart
pierce o pierce each youthful heart
hark how round thy hallow'd shrine
sweetly chaunt the tuneful nine
o'er the green enamel'd plains
pouring all their magic strains
phoebus now with fervid rays
lights thy altar's holy blaze
and touching soft his magic lyre
joins the sweet aonian choir
on the banks of the severn a desperate maid
whom some shepherd neglecting his vows had betray'd
stood resolving to banish all sense of the pain
and pursue thro' her death a revenge on the swain
since the gods and my passion at once he defies
since his vanity lives whilst my character dies
no more did she say will i trifle with fate
but commit to the waves both my love and my hate
and now to comply with that furious desire
just ready to plunge and alone to expire
some reflections on death and its terrors untry'd
some scorn for the shepherd some flashings of pride
at length pull'd her back and she cry'd why this strife
since the swains are so many and i've but one life
once on a time as old stories reherse
a fryer would needs show his talent in latin
but was sorely put to't in the midst of a verse
when behold the next morning a wonderful riddle
he found it was strangely fill'd in the middle
let censuring criticks then think what they list on't
who would not write verses with such an assistant
this put me the fryar into an amazement
that came through the keyhole or in at the casement
howe'er it was civil in angel or elf
for he ne're could have fill'd it so well of himself
even so master doctor had puzzled his brains
he had mixt little wit with a great deal of pains
and tho' some malicious young spirit did do't
you may know by the hand it had no cloven foot
dear colin prevent my warm blushes
since how can i speak without pain
my eyes have oft told you their wishes
ah can't you their meaning explain
my passion wou'd lose by expression
and you too might cruelly blame
then don't you expect a confession
of what is too tender to name
since yours is the province of speaking
why shou'd you expect it of me
our wishes shou'd be in our keeping
'till you tell us what they shou'd be
then quickly why don't you discover
did your breast feel tortures like mine
eyes need not tell over and over
what i in my bosom consine
i sigh and lament me in vain
alas it increases my pain
through the grates of my prison i see
my heart how it pants to be free
ye roofs where cold damps and dismay
how comfortless passes the day
the owls from the battlements cry
'o mary prepare thee to die'
unchang'd by the rigors of fate
though fortune has clouded my state
false woman in ages to come
and when we are cold in the tomb
on the brow of a hill a young shepherdess dwelt
who no pangs of ambition or love had e'er felt
for a few sober maxims still ran in her head
that'twas better to earn ere she eat her brown bread
that to rise with the lark was conducive to health
and to folks in a cottage contentment was wealth
who at church and at market was reckon'd a beau
had many times try'd o'er her heart to prevail
and would rest on his pitchfork to tell her his tale
with his winning behaviour he melted her heart
but quite artless herself she suspected no art
he had sigh'd and protested had kneel'd and implor'd
and could lye with the grandeur and air of a lord
then her eyes he commended in language well drest
and enlarg'd on the torments that troubled his breast
'till his sighs and his tears had so wrought on her mind '
that in downright compassion to love she inclin'd
but as soon as he'd melted the ice of her breast
all the flames of his love in a moment decreast
and at noon he goes flaunting all over the vale
where he boasts of his conquest to susan and nell
tho' he sees her but seldom he's always in haste
and if ever he mentions her makes her his jest
all the day she goes sighing and hanging her head
and her thoughts are so pester'd she scarce earns her bread
the whole village cry shame when a milking she goes
that so little affection is shew'd to the cows
but she heeds not their railing e'en let 'em rail on
and a fig for the cows now her sweetheart is gone
now beware ye young virgins of britain's gay isle
how ye yield up your hearts to a look and a smile
for cupid is artful and virgins are frail
and you'll find a false roger in every vale
who to court you and tempt you will try all his skill
but remember the lass on the brow of the hill
no more of my harriot of polly no more
nor all the bright beauties that charm'd me before
my heart for a slave to gay venus i've sold
and barter'd my freedom for ringlets of gold
i'll throw down my pipe and neglect all my flocks
and will sing to my lass with the golden locks
tho' o'er her white forehead the gilt tresses flow
like the rays of the sun on a hillock of snow
such painters of old drew the queen of the fair
'tis the taste of the antients 'tis classical hair
and tho' witlings may scoff and tho' raillery mocks
yet i'll sing to my lass with the golden locks
to live and to love to converse and be free
is loving my charmer and living with thee
away go the hours in kisses and rhime
spite of all the grave lectures of old father time
a fig for his dials his watches and clocks
he's best spent with the lass of the golden locks
than the swan in the brook she's more dear to my sight
her mien is more stately her breast is more white
her sweet lips are rubies all rubies above
which are fit for the language or labour of love
at the park in the mall at the play in the box
my lass bears the bell with her golden locks
her beautiful eyes as they roll or they flow
shall be glad for my joy or shall weep for my woe
she shall ease my fond heart and shall sooth my soft pain
while thousands of rivals are sighing in vain
let them rail at the fruit they can't reach like the fox
while i have the lass with the golden locks
dear rose as i lately was writing some verse
which i next day intended in school to rehearse
my mother came in and i thought she'd run wild
this mr macmullen has ruin'd my child
he uses me ill and the world shall know it
i sent you to latin he makes you a poet
a fine way of training a shop keeper's son
'twould better become him to teach you to dun
let him teach both his wit and his rhyming to rose
and give you some lessons to help to sell cloaths
he'll have an estate and 'twill do very well
that he like his father in arts should excel
but for you if your father will take my advice
he'll send you no more till he lowers his price
a guinea a quarter 'tis monstrously dear
you might learn to dance for four guineas a year
then sir tell your master that these are hard times
and paper's too dear to be wasted in rhymes
i'll teach you a way of employing it better
as july the fifteenth lord levington debtor
you may rhyme till you're blind what arises from thence
but debtor and creditor brings in the pence
those beggarly muses but come for a curse
but give me the wit that puts gold in the purse
from what she then told me i plainly discern
what different lessons we scholars must learn
you're happy dear rose for as far as i find
you've nothing to do but embellish your mind
what different tasks are assign'd us by fate
'tis yours to become mine to get an estate
then rose mind your learning whatever you do
for i have the easier task of the two
life the dear precarious boon
soon we lose alas how soon
fleeting vision falsely gay
grasp'd in vain it flies away
lovely vision how it fades
mixing with surrounding shades
let the muse in fancy's glass
catch the phantoms as they pass
see they rise a nymph behold
careless wanton young and bold
mark her devious hasty pace
antic dress and thoughtless face
smiling cheeks and roving eyes
causeless mirth and vain surprise
tripping at her side a boy
shares her wonder and her joy
this is folly childhood's guide
that is childhood at her side
what is he succeeding now
myrtles blooming on his brow
bright and blushing as the morn
not on earth a mortal born
wings the flying to pursue
shafts to pierce the strong in view
victim of his power behind
stalks a slave of human kind
whose disdain of all the free
speaks the mind's captivity
love's the tyrant youth's the slave
youth in vain is wise or brave
love with conscious pride defies
all the brave and all the wise
who art thou with anxious mien
stealing o'er the shifting scene
eyes with tedious vigils red
sighs by doubts and wishes bred
cautious step and glancing leer
speak thy woes and speak thy fear
arm in arm what wretch is he
like thyself who walks with thee
like thy own his fears and woes
all thy pangs his bosom knows
well too well my boding breast
knows the thoughts your looks suggest
anxious busy restless pair
manhood link'd by fate to care
wretched state and yet 'tis dear
fancy close the prospect here
close it or recall the past
spare my eyes my heart the last
vain the wish the last appears
while i gaze it swims in tears
age my future self i trace
moving slow with feeble pace
bending with disease and cares
all the load of life he bears
white his locks his visage wan
strength and ease and hope are gone
death the shadowy form i know
death o'ertakes the dreadful foe
swift they vanish mournful sight
night succeeds imperious night
what these dreadful glooms conceal
fancy's glass can ne'er reveal
when shall time the veil remove
when shall light the scene improve
when shall truth my doubts dispel
awful period who can tell
do you ask why old focus silvanus defies
and leaves not a chestnut in being
'tis not that old focus himself has got eyes
but because he has writ about seeing
ye ladies that live in the city or town
fair winton or alresford so fine and so gay
and ye neat country lasses in clean linen gown
as neat and as blithe and as pretty as they
come away strait to ovington for you can't think
what a charming new walk there is made on the link
look how lovely the prospect the meadows how green
the fields and the woods in the vale or the hill
the trees and the cotage that peeps out between
the clear stream that runs bubbling in many a rill
that will show your fair face as you stand on the brink
and murmurs most sweetly all under the link
how pleasant the morning how clear the blue sky
how pure the fresh air and how healthy the place
your heart goes a pitapat light as a fly
and the blood circles briskly and glows in your face
wou'd you paint your fair cheeks with the rose and the pink
throw your washes away take a walk on the link
after dinner the 'squire ere the ladies retreat
marches off with some friends that will ply the brisk glass
gives us liquor enough and a good pleasant seat
and damns your fine taste and your finical lass
al fresco my lads we'll carouse and we'll drink
take your bottle each man and away to the link
not so gentle collin whom love holds in thrall
to molly he steals all in silence away
and when nought can be heard but the rude waterfall
and the woodbine breathes sweetest at close of the day
he takes her soft hand and he tips her the wink
come my dear let us take a cool walk on the link
but o ye fair maidens be sure have a care
nor lay yourselves open to love's cruel dart
of the hour and the place and the season beware
and guard well each passage that leads to your heart
sly cupid will steal in at some little chink
if you walk in the evening too late on the link
ye poets so lofty who love to retire
from the noise of the town to the stream and the wood
who in epics and tragics with marvellous fire
utter sounds by mere mortals not well understood
here mouthe your loud strain and here ply pen and ink
quit parnassus and pindus and come to the link
and come you who for thought are at little expence
who indite gentle pastoral ballad or song
you see with smooth numbers and not too much sense
how the verses run easy and glibly along
and the rhime at the close how it falls with a clink
so kind are the muses that sport on the link
how oft by the lamp of the pale waning moon
would kitty steal out from the eye of the town
on the beach as she stood when the wild waves would roll
her eye shed a torrent just fresh from the soul
and as o'er the ocean the billows would stray
her sighs follow after as moaning as they
i saw as the ship to the harbour drew near
hope redden her cheek then it blanch'd with chill fear
she wish'd to inquire of the whispering crew
if they'd spoke with the roebuck or aught of her knew
for long in conjecture her fate had been toss'd
nor knew we for certain the roebuck was lost
i pitied her feelings and saw what she'd ask
for innocence ever looks through a thin mask
i stepp'd up to jack oakum his sad head he shook
and cast on sweet kitty a sideglancing look
the roebuck has founder'd the crew are no more
nor again shall jack bowling be welcom'd on shore
sweet kitty suspecting laid hold of my arm
o tell me she cried for my soul's in alarm
is she lost i said nothing whilst jack gave a sigh
then down dropp'd the curtain that hung o'er her eye
fleeting life for a moment seem'd willing to stay
just flutter'd and then fled for ever away
so droops the pale lily surcharg'd with a shower
sunk down as with sorrow so dies the sweet flower
no sunbeam returning no spring ever gay
can give back the soft breath once wafted away
the eyestar once set never rises again
nor pilots one vessel more over the main
reputation love and death
the last all bones the first all breath
the midd'st compos'd of restless fire
from each other wou'd retire
thro' the world resolv'd to stray
every one a several way
exercising as they went
each such power as fate had lent
which if it united were
wretched mortals cou'd not bear
but as parting friends do show
to what place they mean to go
correspondence to engage
nominate their utmost stage
death declar'd he wou'd be found
near the fatal trumpet's sound
or where pestilences reign
and quacks the greater plagues maintain
shaking still his sandy glass
and mowing human flesh like grass
love as next his leave he took
cast on both so sweet a look
as their tempers near disarm'd
one relax'd and t'other warm'd
shades for his retreat he chose
rural plains and soft repose
where no dowry e'er was paid
where no jointure e'er was made
no ill tongue the nymph perplex'd
where no forms the shepherd vex'd
where himself shou'd be the care
of the fond and of the fair
where that was they soon shou'd know
au revoir then turn'd to go
reputation made a pause
suiting her severer laws
second thoughts and third she us'd
weighing consequences mus'd
when at length to both she cry'd
you two safely may divide
to th' antipodes may fall
and reascend th' encompast ball
certain still to meet agen
in the breasts of tortur'd men
who by one too far betray'd
call in t'other to their aid
whilst i tender coy and nice
rais'd and ruin'd in a trice
either six with those i grace
or abandoning the place
no return my nature bears
from green youth or hoary hairs
if thro' guilt or chance i sever
i once parting part for ever
take c at once the inside of my breast
this stupid indiff'rence so often you blame
is not owing to nature to fear or to shame
i am not as cold as a virgin in lead
nor is sunday's sermon so strong in my head
i know but too well how time flies along
that we live but few years and yet fewer are young
but i hate to be cheated and never will buy
long years of repentance for moments of joy
oh was there a man but where shall i find
good sense and goodnature so equally join'd
would value his pleasure contribute to mine
not meanly would boast nor lewdly design
not over severe yet not stupidly vain
for i would have the power tho' not give the pain
no pedant yet learned nor rakehelly gay
or laughing because he has nothing to say
to all my whole sex obliging and free
yet never be fond of any but me
in public preserve the decorum that's just
and shew in his eyes he is true to his trust
then rarely approach and respectfully bow
but not fulsomely pert nor fopishly low
but when the long hours of publick are past
and we meet with champagne and a chicken at last
may ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear
be banish'd afar both discretion and fear
forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd
he may cease to be formal and i to be proud
till lost in the joy we confess that we live
and he may be rude and yet i may forgive
and that my delight may be solidly fix'd
let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd
in whose tender bosom my soul may confide
whose kindness can sooth me whose counsel can guide
from such a dear lover as here i describe
no danger should fright me no millions should bribe
but till this astonishing creature i know
as i long have liv'd chaste i will keep myself so
i never will share with the wanton coquet
or be caught by a vain affectation of wit
the toasters and songsters may try all their art
but never shall enter the pass of my heart
i loath the lewd rake the dress'd fopling despise
before such pursuers the nice virgin flies
and as ovid has sweetly in parables told
we harden like trees and like rivers grow cold
mason snatch the votive lyre
d'arcy lives and i inspire
'tis the muse that deigns to ask
can thy hand forget its task
or can the lyre its strains refuse
to the patron of the muse
hark what notes of artless love
the feather'd poets of the grove
grateful for the bowers they fill
warble wild on sion hill
in tuneful tribute duely paid
to the master of the shade
and shall the bard sit fancyproof
beneath the hospitable roof
where every menial face affords
raptur'd thoughts that want but words
and the patron's dearer part
the gentle sharer of his heart
wears her wonted charms again
time that felt affliction's chain
learns on lighter wings to move
and the tender pledge of love
sweet amelia now is prest
with double transport to her breast
sweet amelia thoughtless why
imitates the general joy
innocent of care or guile
see the lovely mimic smile
and as the heartfelt raptures rise
catch them from her mother's eyes
does the noisy town deny
soothing airs and extacy
sion's shades afford retreat
thither bend thy pilgrim feet
there bid th' imaginary train
coinage of the poet's brain
not only in effects appear
but forms and limbs and features wear
let festive mirth with flow'rets crown'd
lightly tread the measur'd round
and peace that seldom knows to share
the statesman's friendly bowl be there
while rosy health superior guest
loose to the zephyrs bares her breast
and to add a sweeter grace
give her soft amelia's face
mason why this dull delay
haste to sion haste away
there the muse again shall ask
nor thy hand forget its task
nor the lyre its strains refuse
come chloe and give me sweet kisses
for sweeter sure never girl gave
but why in the midst of my blisses
do you ask me how many i'd have
i'm not to be stinted in pleasure
then pr'ythee my charmer be kind
for whilst i love thee above measure
to numbers i'll ne'er be confin'd
count the bees that on hybla are playing
count the flow'rs that enamel its fields
count the flocks that on tempe are straying
or the grain that rich sicily yields
go number the stars in the heaven
count how many sands on the shore
when so many kisses you've given
i still shall be craving for more
to a heart full of love let me hold thee
to a heart which dear chloe is thine
with my arms i'll for ever enfold thee
and twist round thy limbs like a vine
what joy can be greater than this is
my life on thy lips shall be spent
but the wretch that can number his kisses
with few will be ever content
lightsome as convey'd by sparrows
love and beauty cross'd the plains
flights of little pointed arrows
love dispatch'd among the swains
but so much our shepherds dread him
spoiler of their peace profound
swift as scudding fawns they fled him
frighted tho' they felt no wound
now the wanton god grown slier
and for each fond mischief ripe
comes disguis'd in pan's attire
tuning sweet an oaten pipe
echo by the winding river
doubles his deluding strains
while the boy conceals his quiver
from the slow returning swains
as palemon unsuspecting
prais'd the sly musician's art
love his light disguise rejecting
lodg'd an arrow in his heart
cupid will enforce your duty
shepherds and would have you taught
those that timid fly from beauty
may by melody be caught
now the dancing sunbeams play
come and i will lead the way
come with me and we will go
where the rocks of coral grow
come behold what treasures lie
riches hid from human eye
stormy winds are far away
ebbing tides brook no delay
and proclaims the morning nigh
paints with gold the villagespire
and the newwak'd kidlings crop
daisies round the dewy vale
and the lark to greet the morn
soars beyond the shepherd's sight
from the claybuilt cottageridge
see the chattering swallow spring
darting thro' the onearch'd bridge
lo the busy bees employ'd
restless till their task be done
now from sweet to sweet uncloy'd
trickling thro' the crevic'd rock
see the silver stream distill
sweet refreshment for the flock
when 'tis sundrove from the hill
ploughmen for the promis'd corn
ripening o'er the banks of tweed
anxious hear the huntsman's horn
soften'd by the shepherd's reed
sweet oh sweet the warbling throng
all is music mirth and song
at the jocund dawn of day
fervid now the sunbeam glows
drinking deep the morning gem
to refresh her parent stem
pendent o'er his grassy seat
see the flocks forsake the glade
cattle court the breezes bland
not a fluttering zephyr springs
fearful lest the piercing beam
kindly cools the thirsty ground
and revives each fainting flower
now the warbler's throat's in tune
blithsome is the vernal scene
as the plodding ploughman goes
homeward to the hamlet bound
giantlike his shadow grows
o'er the mead the bullock strays
free the furrow'd task is done
and the village windows blaze
mark him from behind the hill
strike the purplepainted sky
round the timedecaying dome
to their highbuilt airy beds
as the lark with varied tune
carrols to the evening loud
breaking thro' a parted cloud
and the curling vapour creeps
o'er the lilyborder'd lake
verges in successive rings
tripping thro' the silken grass
see the rosecomplexion'd lass
with the wellpois'd milkingpail
and the cuckoo bird with two
when home i return'd from the dancing last night
and elate by your praises attempted to write
i familiarly call'd on apollo for aid
and told him how many fine things you had said
he smil'd at my folly and gave me to know
your wit and not mine by your writing you shew
and then says the god still to make you more vain
he hath promis'd that i shall enlighten your brain
when he knows in his heart if he speak but his mind
that no woman alive can now boast i am kind
for since daphne to shun me grew into a laurel
with the sex i have sworn still to keep up the quarrel
i thought it all joke 'till by writing to you
i have prov'd his resentment alas but too true
whether stella's eyes are found
fix'd on earth or glancing round
if her face with pleasure glow
if she sigh at others woe
if her easy air express
conscious worth or soft distress
stella's eyes and air and face
charm with undiminish'd grace
if on her we see display'd
pendant gems and rich brocade
if her chintz with less expence
flows in easy negligence
still she lights the conscious flame
still her charms appear the same
if she strikes the vocal strings
if she's silent speaks or sings
if she sit or if she move
still we love and still approve
vain the casual transient glance
which alone can please by chance
beauty which depends on art
changing with the changing heart
which demands the toilet's aid
i those charms alone can prize
which from constant nature rise
which nor circumstance nor dress
e'er can make or more or less
nay nay censor time i'll be happy today
then preach not to me as my life steals away
the sands in thy glass in soft silence depart
but the drops there in mine fill the tubes of the heart
and thou would'st smile too if my fair one thou'd toast
her charms will dissolve e'en thy age's chill frost
to be young cried old time my own glass i'll forego
then tasted and cried let thy cynthia now know
for this the late rose shall still hang on her cheek
and the soft eye be left its own language to speak
o where is the splendour can shine away sorrow
or where is the treasure can buy off a sigh
did riches e'er purchase the loan of tomorrow
or find out a medicine to cure the moist eye
let wealth spread her carpet and ask the gay hours
to dance in light circles its borders along
they'd sooner tend patrick to nature's green bowers
with norah dear norah the theme of his song
midst the joys of the heart sits one tender affection
to heal every sorrow when tortur'd with pain
and when feeling sinks down into silent dejection
sends hope with her cordial to cheer her again
thus love has shown norah the feints of high station
and told her that peace seldom joins the gay throng
while one sweet smile gives patrick the wealth of a nation
from norah dear norah the theme of his song
come thou rosydimpled boy
source of ev'ry heartfelt joy
leave the blissful bow'rs awhile
paphos and the cyprian isle
visit britain's rocky shore
britons too thy pow'r adore
britons hardy bold and free
own thy laws and yield to thee
haste to sylvia haste away
this is thine and hymen's day
bid her thy soft bondage wear
bid her for love's rites prepare
let the nymphs with many a flow'r
deck the sacred nuptial bow'r
thither lead the lovely fair
and let hymen too be there
only while we love we live
love alone can pleasure give
pomp and pow'r and tinsel state
those false pageants of the great
crowns and scepters envied things
and the pride of eastern kings
are but childish empty toys
when compar'd to love's sweet joys
fancy whose delusions vain
sport themselves with human brain
rival thou of nature's pow'r
can'st from thy exhaustless store
bid a tide of sorrow flow
and whelm the soul in deepest woe
or in the twinkling of an eye
raise it to mirth and jollity
dreams and shadows by thee stand
taught to run at thy command
and along the wanton air
flit like empty gossimer
thee black melancholy of yore
to the swiftwing'd hermes bore
from the mixture of thy line
different natures in thee join
which thou chusest to express
by the variance of thy dress
now like thy sire thou lov'st to seem
light and gay with pinions trim
dipt in all the dyes that glow
in the bend of iris' bow
now like thy mother drear and sad
all in mournful vestments clad
cypress weeds and sable stole
thou rushest on th' affrighted soul
oft i feel thee coming on
when the night hath reach'd her noon
and darkness partner of her reign
round the world hath bound her chain
then with measur'd step and slow
in the churchyard path i go
and while my outward senses sleep
lost in contemplation deep
sudden i stop and turn my ear
and list'ning hear or think i hear
first a dead and sullen sound
walks along the holy ground
then thro' the gloom alternate break
groans and the shrill screechowl's shriek
lo the moon hath hid her head
and the graves give up their dead
by me pass the ghastly crowds
wrapt in visionary shrouds
maids who died with love forlorn
youths who fell by maidens' scorn
helpless sires and matrons old
slain for sordid thirst of gold
and babes who owe their shorten'd date
to cruel stepdames ruthless hate
each their sev'ral errands go
to haunt the wretch that wrought their woe
from their sight the caitiff flies
and his heart within him dies
while a horror damp and chill
thro' his frozen blood doth thrill
and his hair for very dread
bears itself upon his head
when the early breath of day
hath made the shadows flee away
still possess'd by thee i rove
bosom'd in the shelt'ring grove
there with heart and lyre new strung
meditate the lofty song
and if thou my voice inspire
and with wonted frenzy fire
aided by thee i build the rhyme
such as nor the flight of time
nor wasting flame nor eating show'r
nor lightning's blast can e'er devour
or if chance some moral page
my attentive thoughts engage
on i walk with silent tread
under the thickwoven shade
while the thrush unheeded by
tunes her artless minstrelsy
list'ning to their sacred lore
i think on ages long past o'er
when truth and virtue hand in hand
walk'd upon the smiling land
thence my eyes on britain glance
and awaken'd from my trance
while my busy thoughts i rear
oft i wipe the falling tear
when the night again descends
and her shadowy cone extends
o'er the fields i walk alone
by the silence of the moon
hark upon my left i hear
wild musick wand'ring in the air
led by the sound i onward creep
and thro' the neighb'ring hedge i peep
there i spy the fairy band
dancing on the level land
now with step alternate bound
join'd in one continu'd round
now their plighted hands unbind
and such tangled mazes wind
as the quick eye can scarce pursue
and wou'd have puzzled that fam'd clue
which led th' athenian's unskill'd feet
thro' the labyrinth of crete
at the near approach of day
sudden the musick dies away
wasting in the sea of air
and the phantoms disappear
all as the glowworm waxes dim
vanish like a morning dream
and of their revels leave no trace
save the ring upon the grass
when the elphin show is fled
home i haste me to my bed
there if thou with magick wand
on my temples take thy stand
i see in mix'd disorder rise
all that struck my waking eyes
so when i stand and round me gaze
where the fam'd lodona strays
on the woods and thickets brown
that its sedgy margin crown
and watch the vagrant clouds that fly
thro' the vast desart of the sky
when adown i cast my look
on the smooth unruffled brook
while its current clear doth run
and holds its mirrour to the sun
there i see th' inverted scene
fall and meet the eye again
nymph that flies the crowded street
and the proud lord's pompous seat
now a naad of the wood
now a dryad of the flood
ever blythe and young and gay
health accept the unpolish'd lay
not the shade of spreading trees
nor the cooling fragrant breeze
nor the lov'd approach of morn
nor the walk through waving corn
nor the blackbird's serenade
echoing from the distant shade
nor the gifts of summer's hand
flowrets fair or odours bland
or each cheerful rural sight
yield or pleasure or delight
to the wretch that sighs for thee
sighs for health and liberty
nor disdain alllovely fair
thy everfervent suppliant's prayer
from some distant region haste
norway's hills or russia's waste
from montpelier's vineyards wide
or from tajo's sunny side
or bermuda's western isle
where eternal summers smile
'midst our country deign to stray
come and make our britain gay
fairest daughter of the year
ever blooming lovely may
while thy vivid skies appear
nature smiles and all is gay
thine the flowerypainted mead
pasture fair and mountain green
thine with infantharvest spread
laughing lies the lowland scene
friend of thine the shepherd plays
blithsome near the yellow broom
while his flock that careless strays
seeks the wild thyme's sweet perfume
may with thee i mean to rove
o'er these lawns and vallies fair
tune my gentle lyre to love
cherish hope and soften care
round me shall the village swains
shall the rosy nymphs appear
while i sing in rural strains
may to shepherds ever dear
i had never skill to raise
peans from the vocal strings
to the godlike hero's praise
to the pageant pomp of kings
stranger to the hostile plains
where the brazen trumpets sound
life's purple stream the verdure stains
and heaps promiscuous press the ground
where the murderous cannon's breath
fate denounces from afar
and the loud report of death
stuns the cruel ear of war
stranger to the park and play
birthnight balls and courtly trains
thee i woo my gentle may
tune for thee my native strains
blooming groves and wandering rills
soothe thy vacant poet's dreams
vocal woods and wilds and hills
all her unexalted themes
gentle idle trifling boy
sing of pleasures sing of joy
well you paint the crystal spring
well the flow'ry meadow sing
but beware with bolder flight
tempt not heaven's unequal height
but beware with impious strain
mock not freedom's hallow'd train
sacred here o ever be
heaven and heavenborn liberty
let the slaves of lawless sway
let the stupid flock obey
pent within a narrow fold
ty'd and stript and slain and sold
happier stars the brave befriend
britons know a nobler end
theirs it is to temper laws
theirs to watch in freedom's cause
theirs one common good to share
theirs to feel one common care
in the glorious task combin'd
from the monarch to the hind
yet o cease not gentle boy
like thy brothers of the wing
idly hop and chirp and sing
heaven can nothing vain produce
ev'ry creature has its use
thine it is to sooth our toil
thine to make e'en wisdom smile
much they err who such despise
trifles please the truly wise
the wars are all o'er and my harry's at hame
what else can i want now i've got him again
yet i kenna how 'tis for i laugh and i cry
and i sigh and i sab yet it maun be for joy
my harry he smiles and he wipes aff the tear
an' i'm doubtfu' again gin it can be he's here
till he takes wee bit janet to sit on his knee
and ca's her his dawty for oh she's like me
then the neighbours come in and they welcome him hame
and i fa' a greeting though much i think shame
then i steal ben the house while they talk o' the war
for i turn cauld as death when he shows them a scar
they tell o' ane elliot an' brave he maun be
but i ken a poor soldier as brave yet as he
for when that the spaniards were wreck'd on the tide
they are soldiers my lads let us save them he cried
the neighbours being gane and the bairns on his knee
he fetch'd a lang sigh and he look'd sair at me
poor woman quo' he ye'd hae muckle to do
to get bread to yoursel and thir wee bit things too
it is true my dear harry i toil'd verra hard
sent elspa to service and jocky to herd
for i knew unca weel 'twas an auld soldier's pride
aye to take frae his king but frae nae ane beside
then guide ye my pension quo' harry my life
'mang a' the king's troops wha can match me a wife
when young she was handsome they envy'd me sair
but now when she's auld they may envy me mair
what's a' the wide world to the joys o' the heart
what are riches and splendour to those that maun part
and might i this moment an emperor be
i'd thraw down the crown gin it kept me frae thee
the virgin when soften'd by may
attends to the villager's vows
the birds sweetly bill on the spray
and poplars embrace with their boughs
on ida bright venus may reign
ador'd for her beauty above
we shepherds that live on the plain
hail may as the mother of love
from the west as it wantonly blows
fond zephyr caresses the pine
the bee steals a kiss from the rose
and willows and woodbines entwine
the pinks by the rivulet's side
that border the vernal alcove
bend downwards to kiss the soft tide
for may is the mother of love
may tinges the butterfly's wing
he flutters in bridal array
if the larks and the linnets now sing
their music is taught them by may
the stockdove recluse with her mate
conceals her fond bliss in the grove
and murmuring seems to repeat
that may is the mother of love
the goddess will visit you soon
ye virgins be sportive and gay
get your pipes oh ye shepherds in tune
for music must welcome the may
would damon have phillis prove kind
and all his keen anguish remove
let him tell a soft tale and he'll find
long with undistinguish'd flame
i lov'd each fair each witty dame
my heart the belleassembly gain'd
and all an equal sway maintain'd
but when you came you stood confess'd
sole sultana of my breast
for you eclips'd supremely fair
all the whole seraglio there
in this her mien in that her grace
in a third i lov'd a face
but you in ev'ry feature shine
universally divine
what can those tumid paps excel
do they sink or do they swell
while those lovely wanton eyes
sparkling meet them as they rise
thus is silver cynthia seen
glistening o'er the glassy green
while attracted swell the waves
emerging from their inmost caves
when to sweet sounds your steps you suit
and weave the minuet to the lute
heav'ns how you glide her neck her chest
does she move or does she rest
as those roguish eyes advance
let me catch their sidelong glance
soon or they'll elude my sight
quick as light'ning and as bright
thus the bashful pleiad cheats
the gazer's eye and still retreats
then peeps agen then skulks unseen
veil'd behind the azure skreen
like the evertoying dove
smile immensity of love
be venus in each outward part
and wear the vestal in your heart
when i ask a kiss or so
grant it with a begging no
and let each rose that decks your face
blush assent to my embrace
such sweetness and goodness together combin'd
so beauteous her face and so bright is her mind
so loving yet chaste and so humble yet fair
so comely her shape and so decent her air
so skilful that nature's improv'd by her art
so prudent her head and so bounteous her heart
so wise without pride and so modestly neat
'tis strange this agreeable creature's a cheat
for tho' she to man for a mortal was giv'n
these virtues betray her extraction from heav'n
what do scholars and bards and astronomers wise
mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies
by telling us venus must always appear
in a car or a shell or a twinkling star
drawn by sparrows or swans or dolphins or doves
attended in form by the graces and loves
that ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste
and her passport to hearts on a belt round her waist
without all this bustle i saw the bright dame
to supper last night to py's she came
in a good warm sedan no fine open car
two chairmen her doves and a flambeau her star
no nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat
her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat
nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace
for rd that night had lent her her face
once a grove of sweet myrtles soft venus would rear
'twas a green shade for hope in each change of the year
hymen mark'd out the spot and would plant some sweet flower
which cupid snatch'd up to set fire to the bower
the taper burnt clear yet no leaf would consume
it just warm'd the buds and increas'd their perfume
hope ran from her covert to hymen she flew
your grove's in no danger 'tis sacred to you
my torch for the purpose i've dipp'd in a flame
'twas lit for a pair whose one wish is the same
while this sweet wish to please circles thro' every day
and the heart looking back shall perceive no decay
kind relief in all my pain
jolly bacchus hear my pray'r
vengeance on th' ingrateful fair
in thy smiling cordial bowl
drown the sorrows of my soul
all thy deity employ
gild each gloomy thought with joy
jolly bacchus save oh save
from the deep devouring grave
a poor despairing dying swain
lash thy tigers do not stay
i'm undone if thou delay
if i view those eyes once more
still shall love and still adore
and be more wretched than before
see the glory round her face
see her move
with what a grace
ye gods above
is she not one of your immortal race
fly ye winged cupids fly
dart like light'ning thro' the sky
you'd ye in marble temples dwell
the dear one to my arms compel
bring her in bands of myrtle tied
bid her forget and bid her hide
all her scorn and all her pride
wou'd ye that your slave repay
a smoaking hecatomb each day
the beauteous goddess i adore
o restore with all her charms
the faithless vagrant to my arms
while you my dear girls in your paradise stray
diverting with innocent freedom the day
i wander alone in a barbarous land
half bak'd by the sun half blind by the sand
then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight
they give me no respite by day nor by night
no sooner asleep but i'm dreaming of you
i am just wak'd from one wou'd to god it were true
methought i was now a fine gentleman grown
and had got lord knows how an estate of my own
goodbye to plain tom i was rais'd a peg higher
some call'd me his worship and others the squire
'twas a place i remember exactly like easton
a scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on
there i built a fine house with great cost and great care
your la'ships have form'd many such in the air
not of stucco nor brick but as good portland stone
as kent wou'd desire to be working upon
the apartments not small nor monstrously great
but chiefly for use and a little for state
so begilt and becarv'd and with ornaments grac'd
that ev'ry one said i'd an excellent taste
here i liv'd like a king never hoarded my pelf
kept a coach for my sisters a nag for myself
with something that's good when our highclear friends come
and spite of 'squire herbert a fire in each room
a canal made for profit as well as for pleasure
that's about let me see two acres in measure
both the eye to delight and the table to crown
with a jack or a perch when my uncles come down
an exceeding great wood that's been set a great while
in length near a league and in breadth near a mile
there ev'ry dear girl her bright genius displays
in a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways
o how charming the walks to my fancy appear
what a number of temples and grottos are here
my soul was transported to such an extreme
that i leap'd up in raptures when lo 'twas a dream
then vexing i chid the impertinent day
for driving so sweet a delusion away
thus spectres arise as by nursemaids we're told
and hie to the place where they buried their gold
there hov'ring around until morning remain
then sadly return to their torments again
ye shepherds who sport on the plain
my heart was a stranger to pain
when deck'd with his pipe and his crook
so sweetly the shepherd did look
but alas t'other day at the fair
he bought ribbons for phillis's hair
sweet songs to beguile the dull hours
a posie of mayblowing flowers
last week as they sat in the grove
their converse i'm sure was of love
i heard the soft words that he sung
each accent that fell from his tongue
my charmer said he is more fair
what's thyme with her breath to compare
the rose when compar'd with her cheek
when sol thro' a shower doth break
alas if they never had met
i wish he would phillis forget
each day wou'd i sing thro' the grove
but if he has settled his love
adieu to contentment and rest
for i fear i can never be bless'd
to the grave will i carry my truth
be careful to shun the false youth
come join all ye nymphs of the grove
at length i have conquer'd my love
my bow'r shall with chaplets be dress'd
for my bosom no more is oppress'd
oh jealousy merciless foe
each day was a compound of woe
i envied the nymphs and the swains
because they were strangers to pain
young daphne the sprightly and gay
with damon did wantonly play
i fear'd that her charms would beguile
i could not allow him to smile
gay colin by all is approv'd
he has often declar'd that he lov'd
but why do i muse on past woe
what blessing can heaven bestow
no danger or peril i fear
while bless'd in the smiles of my dear
together we sport all the day
or else o'er the meadows we stray
adieu to all anguish and care
no longer will delia despair
then join all ye nymphs of the grove
ye shepherds so cheerful and gay
whose flocks never carelessly roam
should corydon's happen to stray
oh call the poor wanderers home
allow me to muse and to sigh
nor talk of the change that ye find
none once was so watchful as i
i have left my dear phyllis behind
now i know what it is to have strove
with the torture of doubt and desire
what it is to admire and to love
and to leave her we love and admire
ah lead forth my flock in the morn
and the damps of each ev'ning repell
alas i am faint and forlorn
i have bade my dear phyllis farewell
since phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look
i never once dreamt of my vine
may i lose both my pipe and my crook
if i knew of a kid that was mine
i priz'd every hour that went by
beyond all that had pleas'd me before
but now they are past and i sigh
and i grieve that i priz'd them no more
but why do i languish in vain
why wander thus pensively here
oh why did i come from the plain
where i fed on the smiles of my dear
they tell me my favourite maid
the pride of that valley is flown
alas where with her i have stray'd
i could wander with pleasure alone
when forc'd the fair nymph to forego
what anguish i felt at my heart
yet i thought but it might not be so
'twas with pain that she saw me depart
she gaz'd as i slowly withdrew
my path i could hardly discern
so sweetly she bade me adieu
i thought that she bade me return
the pilgrim that journeys all day
to visit some fardistant shrine
if he bear but a relique away
is happy nor heard to repine
thus widely remov'd from the fair
where my vows my devotion i owe
soft hope is the relique i bear
and my solace wherever i go
my banks they are furnish'd with bees
whose murmur invites one to sleep
my grottos are shaded with trees
and my hills are whiteover with sheep
i seldom have met with a loss
such health do my fountains bestow
my fountains all border'd with moss
where the harebells and violets grow
not a pine in my grove is there seen
but with tendrils of woodbine is bound
not a beech's more beautiful green
but a sweetbriar twines it around
not my fields in the prime of the year
more charms than my cattle unfold
not a brook that is limpid and clear
but it glitters with fishes of gold
one would think she might like to retire
to the bow'r i have labour'd to rear
not a shrub that i heard her admire
but i hasted and planted it there
o how sudden the jessamin strove
with the lilac to render it gay
already it calls for my love
to prune the wild branches away
from the plains from the woodlands and groves
what strains of wild melody flow
how the nightingales warble their loves
from thickets of roses that blow
and when her bright form shall appear
each bird shall harmoniously join
in a concert so soft and so clear
as she may not be fond to resign
i have found out a gift for my fair
i have found where the woodpigeons breed
but let me that plunder forbear
she will say 'twas a barbarous deed
for he ne'er could be true she aver'd
who could rob a poor bird of its young
and i lov'd her the more when i heard
such tenderness fall from her tongue
i have heard her with sweetness unfold
how that pity was due to a dove
that it ever attended the bold
and she call'd it the sister of love
but her words such a pleasure convey
so much i her accents adore
let her speak and whatever she say
methinks i should love her the more
can a bosom so gentle remain
unmov'd when her corydon sighs
will a nymph that is fond of the plain
these plains and this valley despise
dear regions of silence and shade
soft scenes of contentment and ease
where i could have pleasingly stray'd
if aught in her absence could please
but where does my phyllida stray
and where are her grots and her bow'rs
are the groves and the valleys as gay
and the shepherds as gentle as ours
the groves may perhaps be as fair
and the face of the valleys as fine
the swains may in manners compare
but their love is not equal to mine
why will you my passion reprove
why term it a folly to grieve
ere i shew you the charms of my love
she is fairer than you can believe
with her mien she enamours the brave
with her wit she engages the free
with her modesty pleases the grave
she is ev'ry way pleasing to me
o you that have been of her train
come and join in my amorous lays
i could lay down my life for the swain
that will sing but a song in her praise
when he sings may the nymphs of the town
come trooping and listen the while
nay on him let not phillida frown
but i cannot allow her to smile
for when paridel tries in the dance
any favour with phyllis to find
o how with one trivial glance
might she ruin the peace of my mind
in ringlets he dresses his hair
and his crook is bestudded around
and his pipe oh may phyllis beware
of a magic there is in the sound
'tis his with mock passion to glow
'tis his in smooth tales to unfold
how her face is as bright as the snow
and her bosom be sure is as cold
how the nightingales labour the strain
with the notes of his charmer to vie
how they vary their accents in vain
repine at her triumphs and die
to the grove or the garden he strays
and pillages every sweet
then suiting the wreath to his lays
he throws it at phyllis's feet
o phyllis he whispers more fair
more sweet than the jessamin's flow'r
what are pinks in a morn to compare
what is eglantine after a show'r
then the lily no longer is white
then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom
then the violets die with despight
and the woodbines give up their perfume
thus glide the soft numbers along
and he fancies no shepherd his peer
yet i never should envy the song
were not phyllis to lend it an ear
let his crook be with hyacinths bound
so phyllis the trophy despise
let his forehead with laurels be crown'd
so they shine not in phillis's eyes
the language that flows from the heart
is a stranger to paridel's tongue
yet may she beware of his art
or sure i must envy the song
ye shepherds give ear to my lay
and take no more heed of my sheep
they have nothing to do but to stray
i have nothing to do but to weep
yet do not my folly reprove
she was fair and my passion begun
she smil'd and i could not but love
she is faithless and i am undone
perhaps i was void of all thought
perhaps it was plain to foresee
that a nymph so compleat would be sought
by a swain more engaging than me
ah love ev'ry hope can inspire
it banishes wisdom the while
and the lip of the nymph we admire
seems for ever adorn'd with a smile
ye that witness the woes i endure
let reason instruct you to shun
what it cannot instruct you to cure
beware how ye loiter in vain
amid nymphs of an higher degree
it is not for me to explain
how fair and how fickle they be
alas from the day that we met
what hope of an end to my woes
when i cannot endure to forget
the glance that undid my repose
yet time may diminish the pain
the flow'r and the shrub and the tree
which i rear'd for her pleasure in vain
in time may have comfort for me
the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose
the sound of a murmuring stream
the peace which from solitude flows
henceforth shall be corydon's theme
high transports are shewn to the sight
but we are not to find them our own
fate never bestow'd such delight
as i with my phyllis had known
o ye woods spread your branches apace
to your deepest recesses i fly
i would hide with the beasts of the chace
i would vanish from every eye
yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove
with the same sad complaint it begun
how she smil'd and i could not but love
was faithless and i am undone
pretty nymph within this shade
whilst the flocks to rest are laid
whilst the world dissolves in heat
take this cool and flow'ry seat
and with pleasing talk a while
let us two the time beguile
tho' thou here no shepherd see
to encline his humble knee
or with melancholy lays
sing thy dangerous beauty's praise
nymph with thee i here wou'd stay
but have heard that on this day
near those beeches scarce in view
all the swains some mirth pursue
to whose meeting now i haste
solitude do's life but waste
prithee but a moment stay
no my chaplet wou'd decay
ev'ry drooping flow'r wou'd mourn
and wrong the face they shou'd adorn
i can tell thee tho' so fair
and dress'd with all that rural care
most of the admiring swains
will be absent from the plains
gay sylvander in the dance
meeting with a shrew'd mischance
to his cabin's now confin'd
by mopsus who the strain did bind
damon through the woods do's stray
where his kids have lost their way
young narcissus iv'ry brow
rac'd by a malicious bough
keeps the girilish boy from sight
till time shall do his beauty right
where's alexis
lies extended on the grass
tears his garland raves despairs
mirth and harmony forswears
since he was this morning shown
that delia must not be his own
foolish swain such love to place
on any but dorinda's face
hasty nymph i said not so
no but i thy meaning know
ev'ry shepherd thou wou'd'st have
not thy lover but thy slave
to encrease thy captive train
never to be lov'd again
but since all are now away
no the strangers from the vale
sure will not this meeting fail
graceful one the other fair
he too with the pensive air
told me ere he came this way
he was wont to look more gay
see how pride thy heart inclines
to think for thee that shepherd pines
when those words that reach'd thy ear
chloe was design'd to hear
chloe who did near thee stand
and his more speaking looks command
now thy envy makes me smile
that indeed were worth his while
chloe next thyself decay'd
and no more a courted maid
next myself young nymph forbear
still the swains allow me fair
tho' not what i was that day
when colon bore the prize away
till all the evening sports are past
till no streak of light is seen
nor footstep prints the flow'ry green
what thou wert i need not know
what i am must haste to show
only this i now discern
from the things thou'd'st have me learn
that womankind's peculiar joys
from past or present beauties rise
ye nymphs ah give ear to my lay
for damon the youthful and gay
that shepherd so blithsome and fair
has left us alas in despair
his life was a compound of joy
no envy his bliss cou'd annoy
he scorn'd to deceive or betray
he always was blithsome and gay
in the shade when reclin'd on his crook
my flocks i have often forsook
each bird did attend on the spray
sweet harmony join'd the soft lay
my lambkins are straying far wide
my crook is with scorn thrown aside
i will riffle the jessamin bow'rs
with myrtle and sweet scented flow'rs
while eglantine sheds a perfume
while the cowslip continues to bloom
while the lambkins shall graze on the plain
as long as old time shall remain
but alas the lov'd youth is no more
each shepherd the loss shall deplore
since truth like my damon's must yield
ye swains ah make virtue your shield
a drunken old scot by the rigorous sentence
of the kirk was condemn'd to the stool of repentance
mess john to his conscience his vices put home
and his danger in this and the world that's to come
thou reprobate mortal why dost not thou know
whither after your death all you drunkards must go
must go when we're dead why sir you may swear
we shall go one and all where we find the best beer
give me o indulgent fate
give me yet before i dye
a sweet but absolute retreat
'mongst paths so lost and trees so high
that the world may ne'er invade
through such windings and such shade
my unshaken liberty
no intruders thither come
who visit but to be from home
none who their vain moments pass
only studious of their glass
news that charm to listning ears
that false alarm to hopes and fears
that common theme for every fop
from the statesman to the shop
in those coverts ne'er be spread
of who's deceas'd or who's to wed
be no tidings thither brought
but silent as a midnight thought
where the world may ne'er invade
be those windings and that shade
courteous fate afford me there
a table spread without my care
with what the neighb'ring fields impart
whose cleanliness be all it's art
when of old the calf was drest
tho' to make an angel's feast
in the plain unstudied sauce
nor treufle nor morillia was
nor cou'd the mighty patriarch's board
one farfetch'd ortolane afford
courteous fate then give me there
only plain and wholesome fare
fruits indeed wou'd heaven bestow
all that did in eden grow
all but the forbidden tree
wou'd be coveted by me
grapes with juice so crouded up
as breaking thro' the native cup
figs yet growing candy'd o'er
by the sun's attracting pow'r
cherries with the downy peach
all within my easie reach
whilst creeping near the humble ground
shou'd the strawberry be found
springing wheresoe'er i stray'd
thro' those windings and that shade
for my garments let them be
what may with the time agree
warm when phoebus does retire
and is illsupply'd by fire
but when he renews the year
and verdant all the fields appear
beauty every thing resumes
birds have dropt their winterplumes
when the lilly full display'd
stands in purer white array'd
than that vest which heretofore
the luxurious monarch wore
when from salem's gates he drove
to the soft retreat of love
lebanon's all burnish'd house
and the dear egyptian spouse
cloath me fate tho' not so gay
cloath me light and fresh as may
in the fountains let me view
all my habit cheap and new
such as when sweet zephyrs fly
with their motions may comply
gently waving to express
unaffected carelesness
no perfumes have there a part
borrow'd from the chymists art
but such as rise from flow'ry beds
or the falling jasmin sheds
'twas the odour of the field
esau's rural coat did yield
that inspir'd his father's pray'r
for blessings of the earth and air
of gums or pouders had it smelt
the supplanter then unfelt
easily had been descry'd
for one that did in tents abide
for some beauteous handmaids joy
and his mother's darling boy
let me then no fragrance wear
but what the winds from gardens bear
in such kind surprizing gales
as gather'd from fidentia's vales
all the flowers that in them grew
which intermixing as they flew
in wreathen garlands dropt agen
on lucullus and his men
who chear'd by the victorious sight
trebl'd numbers put to flight
let me when i must be fine
in such natural colours shine
wove and painted by the sun
whose resplendent rays to shun
when they do too fiercely beat
let me find some close retreat
where they have no passage made
give me there since heaven has shown
it was not good to be alone
a partner suited to my mind
solitary pleas'd and kind
who partially may something see
preferr'd to all the world in me
slighting by my humble side
fame and splendor wealth and pride
when but two the earth possest
'twas their happiest days and best
they by bus'ness nor by wars
they by no domestick cares
from each other e'er were drawn
but in some grove or flow'ry lawn
spent the swiftly flying time
spent their own and nature's prime
in love that only passion given
to perfect man whilst friends with heaven
rage and jealousie and hate
transports of his fallen state
when by satan's wiles betray'd
fly those windings and that shade
thus from crouds and noise remov'd
let each moment be improv'd
every object still produce
thoughts of pleasure and of use
when some river slides away
to encrease the boundless sea
think we then how time do's haste
to grow eternity at last
by the willows on the banks
gather'd into social ranks
playing with the gentle winds
strait the boughs and smooth the rinds
moist each fibre and each top
wearing a luxurious crop
let the time of youth be shown
the time alas too soon outgrown
whilst a lonely stubborn oak
which no breezes can provoke
no less gusts persuade to move
than those which in a whirlwind drove
spoil'd the old fraternal feast
and left alive but one poor guest
rivell'd the distorted trunk
sapless limbs all bent and shrunk
sadly does the time presage
of our too near approaching age
when a helpless vine is found
unsupported on the ground
careless all the branches spread
subject to each haughty tread
bearing neither leaves nor fruit
living only in the root
back reflecting let me say
so the sad ardelia lay
blasted by a storm of fate
felt thro' all the british state
fall'n neglected lost forgot
dark oblivion all her lot
faded till arminda's love
guided by the pow'rs above
warm'd anew her drooping heart
and life diffus'd thro' every part
mixing words in wise discourse
of such weight and wond'rous force
as could all her sorrows charm
and transitory ills disarm
chearing the delightful day
when dispos'd to be more gay
with wit from an unmeasured store
to woman ne'er allow'd before
what nature or refining art
all that fortune cou'd impart
heaven did to arminda send
then gave her for ardelia's friend
to her cares the cordial drop
which else had overflow'd the cup
so when once the son of jess
every anguish did oppress
hunted by all kinds of ills
like a partridge on the hills
trains were laid to catch his life
baited with a royal wife
from his house and country torn
made a heathen prince's scorn
fate to answer all these harms
threw a friend into his arms
friendship still has been design'd
the support of humankind
the safe delight the useful bliss
the next world's happiness and this
give then o indulgent fate
give a friend in that retreat
tho' withdrawn from all the rest
still a clue to reach my breast
let a friend be still convey'd
where may i remain secure
waste in humble joys and pure
a life that can no envy yield
want of affluence my shield
thus had crassus been content
when from marius rage he went
with the seat that fortune gave
the commodious ample cave
form'd in a divided rock
by some mighty earthquake's shock
into rooms of every size
fair as art cou'd e'er devise
leaving in the marble roof
'gainst all storms and tempests proof
only passage for the light
to refresh the chearful sight
whilst three sharers in his fate
on th' escape with joy dilate
beds of moss their bodies bore
canopy'd with ivy o'er
rising springs that round them play'd
o'er the native pavement stray'd
when the hour arriv'd to dine
various meats and sprightly wine
on some neighb'ring cliff they spy'd
every day anew supply'd
by a friend's entrusted care
had he still continu'd there
made that lonely wond'rous cave
both his palace and his grave
peace and rest he might have found
peace and rest are under ground
nor have been in that retreat
fam'd for a proverbial fate
in pursuit of wealth been caught
and punish'd with a golden draught
nor had he who crowds cou'd blind
whisp'ring with a snowy hind
made 'em think that from above
like the great impostor's dove
tydings to his ears she brought
rules by which he march'd and fought
after spain he had o'errun
cities sack'd and battles won
drove rome's consuls from the field
made her darling pompey yield
at a fatal treacherous feast
felt a dagger in his breast
had he his oncepleasing thought
of solitude to practice brought
had no wild ambition sway'd
in those islands had he stay'd
justly call'd the seats of rest
truly fortunate and blest
by the ancient poets giv'n
as their best discover'd heav'n
let me then indulgent fate
let me still in my retreat
from all roving thoughts be freed
or aims that may contention breed
nor be my endeavours led
by goods that perish with the dead
fitly might the life of man
be indeed esteem'd a span
if the present moment were
of delight his only share
if no other joys he knew
than what round about him grew
but as those who stars wou'd trace
from a subterranean place
through some engine lift their eyes
to the outward glorious skies
so th' immortal spirit may
when descended to our clay
from a rightly govern'd frame
view the height from whence she came
to her paradise be caught
and things unutterable taught
give me then in that retreat
for all pleasures left behind
contemplations of the mind
let the fair the gay the vain
courtship and applause obtain
let th' ambitious rule the earth
let the giddy fool have mirth
give the epicure his dish
ev'ry one their sev'ral wish
whilst my transports i employ
on that more extensive joy
when all heaven shall be survey'd
from those windings and that shade
dan petrarch of old it has often been said
by some cardinal urg'd his fair laura to wed
with an offer of fortune and welltim'd it was
for poets have seldom much rent from parnass'
cried my lord you'll excuse me but i have a reason
why even this offer becomes out of season
i've a new book of sonnets just ripe for the press
upon the same plan as the last you may guess
i have there all along made my laura a goddess
and venus to please me has lent her the boddice
while hebe minerva and twenty to boot
with gifts all celestial have trick'd me her out
now marriage my lord the whole charm would destroy
and hurl her divinity quite from the sky
to my cost i should find her no more than a woman
and my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man
a lady sent lately to one doctor drug
to come in an instant and clyster poor pug
as the fair one commanded he came at the word
and did the grand office in tiewig and sword
the affair being ended so sweet and so nice
he held out his hand with you know ma'am my price
your price says the lady why sir he's your brother
and doctors must never take fees of each other
if e'er in thy sight i found favour apollo
defend me from all the disasters which follow
from the knaves and the fools and the fops of the time
from the drudges in prose and the triflers in rhyme
from the pacthwork and toils of the royal sackbibber
those dead birthday odes and the farces of cibber
from servile attendance on men in high places
their worships and honours and lordships and graces
from long dedications to patrons unworthy
who hear and receive but will do nothing for thee
from being caress'd to be left in the lurch
the tool of a party in state or in church
from dull thinking blockheads as sober as turks
and petulant bards who repeat their own works
from all the gay things of a drawingroom show
the sight of a belle and the smell of a beau
from busy backbiters and tatlers and carpers
and scurvy acquaintance of fidlers and sharpers
from old politicians and coffeehouse lectures
the dreams of a chymist and schemes of projectors
from the fears of a jail and the hopes of a pension
the tricks of a gamester and oaths of an ensign
from shallow freethinkers in taverns disputing
nor ever confuted nor ever confuting
from the constant good fare of another man's board
my lady's broad hints and the jests of my lord
from hearing old chymists prelecting de olco
and reading of dutch commentators in folio
from waiting like gay whole years at whitehall
from the pride of gay wits and the envy of small
from very fine ladies with very fine incomes
which they finely lay out on fine toys and fine trincums
from the pranks of ridottoes and courtmasquerades
the snares of young jilts and the spite of old maids
from a saucy dull stage and submitting to share
in an empty third night with a beggarly play'r
from curl and such printers as would ha' me curs'd
to write second parts let who will write the first
from all pious patriots who would to their best
put on a new tax and take off an old test
from the faith of informers the fangs of the law
and the great rogues who keep all the lesser in awe
from a poor country cure that living interment
with a wife and no prospect of any preferment
from scribbling for hire when my credit is sunk
to buy a new coat and to line an old trunk
from 'squires who divert us with jokes at their tables
of hounds in their kennels and nags in their stables
from the nobles and commons who bound in strict league are
to subscribe for no book yet subscribe to heidegger
from the cant of fanaticks the jargon of schools
the censures of wisemen and praises of fools
from criticks who never read latin or greek
and pedants who boast they read both all the week
from borrowing wit to repay it like budgel
or lending like pope to be paid by a cudgel
if ever thou didst or wilt ever befriend me
from these and such evils apollo defend me
and let me be rather but honest with nowit
than a noisy nonsensical halfwitted poet
when orpheus went down to the regions below
which men are forbidden to see
he tun'd up his lyre as old histories shew
to set his eurydice free
all hell was astonish'd a person so wise
shou'd rashly endanger his life
and venture so far but how vast their surprise
when they heard that he came for his wife
to find out a punishment due to his fault
old pluto had puzzled his brain
but hell had not torments sufficient he thought
so he gave him his wife back again
but pity succeeding found place in his heart
and pleas'd with his playing so well
he took her again in reward of his art
such merit had music in hell
will you hear how once repining
great eliza captive lay
each ambitious thought resigning
foe to riches pomp and sway
while the nymphs and swains delighted
tript around in all their pride
envying joys by others slighted
thus the royal maiden cry'd
bred on plains or born in vallies
who would bid those scenes adieu
stranger to the arts of malice
who would ever courts pursue
malice never taught to treasure
censure never taught to bear
love is all the shepherd's pleasure
love is all the damsel's care
how can they of humble station
vainly blame the pow'rs above
or accuse the dispensation
which allows them all to love
love like air is widely given
pow'r nor chance can these restrain
truest noblest gifts of heaven
only purest on the plain
peers can no such charms discover
all in stars and garters drest
as on sundays does the lover
with his nosegay on his breast
pinks and roses in profusion
said to fade when chloe's near
fops may use the same allusion
but the shepherd is sincere
hark to yonder milkmaid singing
cheerly o'er the brimming pail
cowslips all around her springing
sweetly paint the golden vale
never yet did courtly maiden
move so sprightly look so fair
never breast with jewels laden
pour a song so void of care
would indulgent heav'n had granted
me some rural damsel's part
all the empire i had wanted
then had been my shepherd's heart
then with him o'er hills and mountains
free from fetters might i rove
fearless taste the crystal fountains
peaceful sleep beneath the grove
rusticks had been more forgiving
partial to my virgin bloom
none had envy'd me when living
none had triumph'd o'er my tomb
tho' rhyme serves the thoughts of great poets to fetter
it sets off the sense of small poets the better
when i've written in prose i often have found
that my sense in a jumble of words was quite drown'd
in verse as in armies that march o'er the plain
the least man among them is seen without pain
this they owe to good order it must be allow'd
else men that are little are lost in a croud
so much for simile now to be brief
the following lines come to tell you my grief
'tis well i can write for i scarcely can speak
i'm so plagu'd with my teeth which eternally ake
when the wind's in the point which opposes the south
for fear of the cold i can't open my mouth
and you know to the sex it must be a heartbreaking
to have any distemper that keeps them from speaking
when first i was silent a day and a night
the women were all in a terrible fright
supplications to jove in an instant they make
avert the portent a woman not speak
since poets are prophets and often have sung
the last thing that dies in a woman's her tongue
o jove for what crime is sapphira thus curst
'tis plain by her breathing her tongue has dy'd first
ye powers celestial tell mortals what cause
occasions dame nature to break her own laws
did the preacher live now from his text he must run
and own there was something new under the sun
o jove for the future this punishment spare
and all other evils we'll willingly bear
then they throng to my house and my maid they beseech
to say if her mistress had quite lost her speech
nell readily own'd what they heard was too true
that today i was dumb give the devil his due
and frankly confess'd were it always the case
no servant could e'er have a happier place
when they found it was fact they began all to fear me
and dreading infection would scarcely come near me
till a neighbour of mine who was famous for speeching
bid them be of good cheer the disease was not catching
and offer'd to prove from authors good store
that the like case with this never happen'd before
and if ages to come should resemble the past
as 'twas the first instance it would be the last
yet against this disorder we all ought to strive
were i in her case i'd been bury'd alive
were i one moment silent except in my bed
my good natur'd husband would swear i was dead
the next said her tongue was so much in her pow'r
she was sullenly silent almost half an hour
that to vex her good man she took this way to teaze him
but soon left it off when she found it would please him
and vow'd for the future she'd make the housering
for when she was dumb he did nothing but sing
quite tir'd with their talking i held down my head
so she who sat next me cry'd out i was dead
they call'd for cold water to throw in my face
give her air give her air and cut open her lace
says good neighbour nevil you're out of your wits
she oft to my knowledge has these sullen fits
let her husband come in and make one step that's wrong
my life for't the woman will soon find her tongue
you'll soon be convinc'd o' my conscience he's here
why what's all this rout are you sullen my dear
this struck them all silent which gave me some ease
and made them imagine they'd got my disease
so they hasted away in a terrible fright
and left me in silence to pass the long night
not the women alone were scar'd at my fate
'twas reckon'd of dreadful portent to the state
when the governors heard it they greatly were troubled
and whilst i was silent the guards were all doubled
the militia drums beat a perpetual alarm
to rouze up the sons of the city to arm
a story was rumour'd about from lambey
of a powerful fleet that was seen off at sea
with horror all list to the terrible tale
the barristers tremble the judges grow pale
to the castle the frighted nobility fly
and the council were summon'd they could not tell why
the clergy in crouds to the churches repair
and armies embattled were seen in the air
why they were in this fright i have lately been told
it seems it was sung by a druid of old
that the hanover race to greatbritain should come
and sit on the throne till a woman grew dumb
as soon as this prophecy reach'd the pretender
he cry'd out my claim to the crown i surrender
says richard to thomas and seem'd half afraid
i am thinking to marry thy mistress's maid
now because mrs martha to thee is well known
i will do't if thou bidst me or let it alone
nay don't make a jest on't 'tis no jest to me
for faith i'm in earnest so prithee be free
i have no fault to find with the girl since i knew her
but i'd have thy advice ere i tye myself to her
said thomas to richard to speak my opinion
there is not such a bitch in king george's dominion
and i firmly believe if thou knew'st her as i do
thou would'st chuse out a whippingpost first to be ty'd to
she's peevish she's thievish she's ugly she's old
and a lyar and a fool and a slut and a scold
next day richard hasten'd to church and was wed
and ere night had inform'd her what thomas had said
grown old and grown stupid you just think me fit
to transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt
and a comfort it is to a wight in distress
he's of some little use but he can't be of less
were greater his talents you might ever command
his head that's worth nought then his heart and his hand
so your mandate obeying he sends you d'ye see
the genuine receipt to make l'eau de la vie
take seven large lemons and pare them as thin
as a wafer or what is yet thinner your skin
a quart of french brandy or rum is still better
for you ne'er in receipts should stick close to the letter
six ounces of sugar next take and pray mind
the sugar must be the best doublerefin'd
boil the sugar in near half a pint of spring water
in the neat silver saucepan you bought for your daughter
but be sure that the syrup you carefully skim
while the scum as 'tis call'd rises up to the brim
the fourth part of a pint you next must allow
of new milk made as warm as it comes from the cow
put the rinds of the lemons the milk and the syrup
with the rum in a jar and give 'em a stir up
and if you approve it you may add some perfume
goastone or whatever you like in its room
let it stand thus three days but remember to shake it
and the closer you stop it the richer you make it
then filter'd thro' paper 'twill sparkle and rise
be as soft as your lips and as bright as your eyes
last bottle it up and believe me the vicar
of e himself ne'er drank better liquor
in a word it excels by a million of odds
the nectar your sister presents to the gods
while the sighing crowd admire
all those dismal looks and fretting
long ago the worms have eat him
once again consult your toilette
so much weeping soon will spoil it
i like you was born a woman
the disease alas is common
all the morals that they tell us
chuse among the pretty fellows
prithee hear him every morning
once again at night returning
all attendants apart
i examin'd my heart
last night when i lay'd me to rest
and methinks i'm inclin'd
to a change of my mind
for you know second thoughts are the best
to retire from the crowd
and make ourselves good
by avoiding of every temptation
is in truth to reveal
what we'd better conceal
that our passions want some regulation
it will much more redound
to our praise to be found
in a world so abounding with evil
unspotted and pure
tho' not so demure
as to wage open war with the devil
then bidding farewell
to the thoughts of a cell
i'll prepare for a militant life
and if brought to distress
why then i'll confess
and do penance in shape of a wife
between nose and eyes a strange contest arose
the spectacles set them unhappily wrong
the point in dispute was as all the world knows
to which the said spectacles ought to belong
so the tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause
with a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning
while chief baron ear sat to balance the laws
so fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning
in behalf of the nose it will quickly appear
and your lordship he said will undoubtedly find
that the nose has had spectacles always in wear
which amounts to possession time out of mind
then holding the spectacles up to the court
your lordship observes they are made with a straddle
as wide as the ridge of the nose is in short
design'd to sit close to it just like a saddle
again would your lordship a moment suppose
'tis a case that has happen'd and may be again
that the visage or countenance had not a nose
pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then
on the whole it appears and my argument shows
with a reasoning the court will never condemn
that the spectacles plainly were made for the nose
and the nose was as plainly intended for them
then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how
he pleaded again in behalf of the eyes
but what were his arguments few people know
for the court did not think they were equally wise
so his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone
decisive and clear without one if or but
that whenever the nose put his spectacles on
by daylight or candlelight eyes should be shut
the favours of fortune i once hop'd to gain
and often invok'd her but ever in vain
she despis'd my addresses which gave me such grief
i flew to the muses in hopes of relief
ah wretch that i was i might very well know
'twas the method to make her for ever my foe
they laugh'd at the goddess and bid me despise her
but time and experience have made me grow wiser
this unhappy mistake i resolve to repair
o fortune thy votaries must persevere
of old when scarron his companions invited
each guest brought his dish and the feast was united
if oura landlord supplies us with beef and with fish
let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish
ourb dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains
ourc burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains
ourd will shall be wild fowl of excellent flavour
ande dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour
ourf cumberland's sweetbread its place shall obtain
andg douglas is pudding substantial and plain
ourh garrick's a sallad for in him we see
oil vinegar sugar and saltness agree
to make out the dinner full certain i am
thati ridge is anchovy andk reynolds is lamb
thatl hickey's a capon and by the same rule
magnanimous goldsmith a goosberry fool
at a dinner so various at such a repast
who'd not be a glutton and stick to the last
here waiter more wine let me sit while i'm able
'till all my companions sink under the table
then with chaos and blunders encircling my head
let me ponder and tell what i think of the dead
here lies the good dean reunited to earth
who mixt reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth
if he had any faults he has left us in doubt
at least in six weeks i could not find 'em out
yet some have declar'd and it can't be denied 'em
that slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em
here lies our good edmund whose genius was such
we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much
who born for the universe narrow'd his mind
and to party gave up what was meant for mankind
tho' fraught with all learning yet straining his throat
to persuadem tommy townsend to lend him a vote
who too deep for his hearers still went on refining
and thought of convincing while they thought of dining
tho' equal to all things for all things unfit
too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit
for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient
and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient
in short 'twas his fate unemploy'd or in place sir
to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor
here lies honest william whose heart was a mint
while the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't
the pupil of impulse it forc'd him along
his conduct still right with his argument wrong
still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam
the coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home
would you ask for his merits alas he had none
what was good was spontaneous his faults were his own
here lies honest richard whose fate i must sigh at
alas that such frolic should now be so quiet
what spirits were his what wit and what whim
n now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb
now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball
now teazing and vexing yet laughing at all
in short so provoking a devil was dick
that we wish'd him full ten times a day at old nick
but missing his mirth and agreeable vein
as often we wish'd to have dick back again
here cumberland lies having acted his parts
the terence of england the mender of hearts
a flattering painter who made it his care
to draw men as they ought to be not as they are
his gallants are all faultless his women divine
and comedy wonders at being so fine
like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out
or rather like tragedy giving a rout
his fools have their follies so lost in a crowd
of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud
and coxcombs alike in their failings alone
adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own
say where has our poet this malady caught
or wherefore his characters thus without fault
say was it that vainly directing his view
to find out mens virtues and finding them few
quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf
he grew lazy at last and drew from himself
here douglas retires from his toils to relax
the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks
come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines
come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines
when satire and censure encircled his throne
i fear'd for your safety i fear'd for my own
but now he is gone and we want a detector
our dodds shall be pious our kenricks shall lecture
macpherson write bombast and call it a style
our townshend make speeches and i shall compile
new lauders and bowers the tweed shall cross over
no countryman living their tricks to discover
detection her taper shall quench to a spark
and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark
here lies david garrick describe me who can
an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man
as an actor confest without rival to shine
as a wit if not first in the very first line
yet with talents like these and an excellent heart
the man had his failings a dupe to his art
like an illjudging beauty his colours he spread
and beplaister'd with rouge his own natural red
on the stage he was natural simple affecting
'twas only that when he was off he was acting
with no reason on earth to go out of his way
he turn'd and he varied full ten times aday
tho' secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick
if they were not his own by finessing and trick
he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack
for he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back
of praise a mere glutton he swallow'd what came
and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame
'till his relish grown callous almost to disease
who pepper'd the highest was surest to please
but let us be candid and speak out our mind
if dunces applauded he paid them in kind
ye kenricks ye kellys and woodfalls so grave
what a commerce was yours while you got and you gave
how did grubstreet reecho the shouts that you rais'd
while he was beroscius'd and you were beprais'd
but peace to his spirit wherever it flies
to act as an angel and mix with the skies
those poets who owe their best fame to his skill
shall still be his flatterers go where he will
old shakespeare receive him with praise and with love
and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above
here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature
and slander itself must allow him goodnature
he cherish'd his friend and he relish'd a bumper
yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper
perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser
i answer no no for he always was wiser
too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat
his very worst foe can't accuse him of that
perhaps he confided in men as they go
and so was too foolishly honest ah no
then what was his failing come tell it and burn ye
he was could he help it a special attorney
here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind
he has not left a wiser or better behind
his pencil was striking resistless and grand
his manners were gentle complying and bland
still born to improve us in every part
his pencil our faces his manners our heart
to coxcombs averse yet most civilly steering
when they judg'd without skill he was still hard of hearing
when they talk'd of their raphaels corregios and stuff
he shifted hiso trumpet and only took snuff
as damon was pensively walking one day
three pretty tight lasses he met in his way
and who should they be that were taking the air
but nelly and molly and charlot so fair
the swain who to beauty had never been blind
thought this was the season to tell 'em his mind
but first he debated to which lovely lass
he should offer his tenders and open his case
that nelly was pretty he could not deny
but molly he thought had the sprightliest eye
so on her his affections they rested awhile
'till charlot appear'd with a look and a smile
with a look and a smile which sure mischief had done
had the swain been encounter'd by charlot alone
perplext in his thought and disturb'd in his breast
and unable to tell which bright lass he lov'd best
he folded his arms to the grove he retir'd
and decently on the green willow expir'd
for three at a time what poor mortal could bear
one alone trust me charlot had made him rejoice
and the swain been quite happy with what
raasa by thy rocky shore
vocal to the ocean's roar
cliffs that have for ages stood
barriers to the briny flood
beneath your dark your dismal shade
wandering wept a woeworn maid
whilst the pauses of the gale
each she fill'd with sorrow's tale
bursting from the sable sky
see the forked lightnings fly
whilst their sad destructive light
gilds awhile the gloom of night
trembling to the blasts that blow
gazing on the gulph below
yielding to the ruthless storm
drooping mark yon angel form
round whose face divinely fair
loosely streams her golden hair
to the rock's sublimest seat
fate has led her wandering feet
yawning wide the greedy deep
woos her to eternal sleep
by the lightning's vivid glare
saw you not yon frantic stare
by the tempest's lurid light
mark her plunge to endless night
struggling mid the boiling wave
nature frighted at the grave
to the rude the rocky strand
faintly points her languid hand
cease ye blasts awhile to blow
drown not now the wail of woe
heard ye not yon piercing groan
that proclaim'd her spirit flown
whilst it soars on seraph wing
roaring waves her requiem sing
still by raasa's seagirt shore
blueey'd maids her fate deplore
from the cliffs sublime and steep
cast thy garlands in the deep
marking thus the day's return
still rumora's fate they mourn
o cambridge attend
to the satire i've penned
on the heads of thy houses
thou seat of the muses
know the master of jesus
does hugely displease us
the master of maudlin
in the same dirt is dawdling
the master of sidney
is of the same kidney
the master of trinity
to him bears affinity
as the master of keys
is as like as two peas
so the master of queen's
is as like as two beans
the master of king's
copies them in all things
the master of catherine
takes them all for his pattern
the master of clare
hits them all to a hair
the master of christ
by the rest is enticed
but the master of emmanuel
follows them like a spaniel
the master of benet
is of the like tenet
the master of pembroke
has from them his system took
the master of peter's
has all the same features
the master of st john's
like the rest of the dons
ps as to trinity hall
we say nothing at all
from sermon to sermon took a slice and went out
then on me in divinity batchelor try'd
many priests to obtrude a levitical bride
and urging their various opinions intended
to make me wed systems which they recommended
said a letch'rous old fry'r skulking near lincoln'sinn
whose trade's to absolve but whose pastimes's to sin
who spiderlike seizes weak protestant flies
which hung in his sophistry cobweb he spies
ah pity your soul for without our church pale
if you happen to die to be damn'd you can't fail
the bible you boast is a wild revelation
hear a church that can't err if you hope for salvation
said a formal noncon whose rich stock of grace
lies forward expos'd in shopwindow of face
ah pity your soul come be of our sect
for then you are safe and may plead you're elect
as it stands in the acts we can prove ourselves saints
being christ's little flock ev'ry where spoke against
said a jolly church parson devoted to ease
while penal law dragons guard his golden fleece
if you pity your soul i pray listen to neither
the first is in error the last a deceiver
that ours is the true church the sense of our tribe is
and surely in medio tutissimus ibis
said a yea and nay friend with a stiff hat and band
who while he talk'd gravely would hold forth his hand
dominion and wealth are the aim of all three
tho' about ways and means they may all disagree
then prithee be wise go the quakers byway
'tis plain without turnpikes so nothing to pay
by the side of the stream that strays thro' the grove
i met in a ramble the blithe god of love
his bow o'er his shoulder was carelessly ty'd
his quiver in negligence clanck'd at his side
a handful of arrows he held to my view
each wing'd with a feather of different hue
this fledg'd from the eagle he smiling begun
i aim at the heart that no dangers will shun
and this from the peacock all gaudy array'd
the breast of sir fopling is sure to invade
when i aim at the prattler who talks void of wit
my shaft in the plume of a parrot will hit
and when i've a mind that the jealous should smart
i pierce with an owlfeather'd arrow his heart
for the youth in whom truth and fondness reside
from the breast of a dove my dart is supply'd
this i value the most 'twas this that i found
from you o my delia that gave me the wound
phoebe thank thy false heart it has fix'd my repose
the gods have had pity at length on my woes
i feel it i feel my soul loose from its chain
and at last freedom comes often dream'd of in vain
the flame is burn'd out and each passion at rest
under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast
no more when thou'rt nam'd the warm blushes arise
no more slutters my heart when i meet with your eyes
in my sleep now no longer thy image i see
nor the first of my thoughts when i wake is of thee
when from thee no more of thy absence i plain
when with thee i feel neither pleasure nor pain
my heart without fondness can muse on thy charms
my past pains i recount yet no passion alarms
discompos'd i'm no longer when tow'rd me you move
and at ease with my rival i talk of my love
whether haughty thy frown whether gentle thy strain
in vain thy proud looks thy fond speeches in vain
thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art
no more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart
whether pensive or cheerful no longer to you
for this are my thanks or for that my blame due
the gay prospect now pleases though you are away
and your presence no more can make dreariness gay
believe me i still can allow that thou'rt fair
but not that no fairone can with thee compare
and though beauteous i own thee yet still in thy face
i can now spy a fault which i once thought a grace
when first the fix'd arrow i pluck'd from my heart
oh methought i shou'd die so severe was the smart
but from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear
torments greater than dying with patience i'd bear
when lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains
nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains
the loss of his plumage small time will restore
and once try'd the false twig it can cheat him no more
the old flame never flatter yourself to believe
while it dwells on my tongue in my heart still must live
our dangers when past with delight we repeat
what in suffering was pain to remembrance is sweet
'tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars
he fights o'er his old battles and vaunts of his scars
with pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd
the fetters thus shows which once held him enchain'd
thus i talk and i still will talk on while i may
nor heed i though you disbelieve what i say
i ask not that phoebe my talk should approve
let her too if she can talk at ease of my love
an inconstant i leave a true lover you lose
which first of us two will have comfort who knows
this i know phoebe ne'er such a true love will find
i can easily meet with a fair as unkind
good madam when ladies are willing
a man must needs look like a fool
for me i wou'd not give a shilling
for one that is kind out of rule
at least you might stay for my offer
not snatch like old maids in despair
if you've liv'd to these years without proffer
your sighs are now lost in the air
you might leave me to guess by your blushing
and not speak the matter so plain
'tis ours to pursue and be pushing
'tis yours to affect a disdain
that you're in a pitiful taking
by all your sweet ogles i see
but the fruit that will fall without shaking
indeed is too mellow for me
too poor for a bribe and too proud to importune
he had not the method of making a fortune
could love and could hate so was thought somewhat odd
no very great wit he believed in a god
a post or a pension he did not desire
but left church and state to charles townshend and squire
sweet companion of the muse
gentle solitude appear
all thy calm content infuse
soften anguish banish care
lead me o majestic queen
thro' the aromatic scene
nature's copied here by art
joyful we the fraud confess
yet so well performs her part
'tis but nature's better dress
solitude here fix my seat
here in cowley's soft retreat
lay me in the silent mead
where the murmuring river flows
where the elm expands the shade
and each rising beauty blows
there i'll say in peace of mind
empty greatness fall behind
teach thy votary all the powers
of each plant and every tree
tell how shortliv'd are the flowers
bring the moral home to me
bid me fleeting life despise
make me humble make me wise
pride within my lowly cell
never yet uprear'd her head
solitude with thee i'll dwell
pride with me is long since dead
cold to pleasure deaf to praise
here i wish to end my days
how fondly i gaze on the fast fallingleaves
that mark as i wander the summer's decline
and then i exclaim while my conscious heart heaves
thus early to droop and to perish be mine
yet once i remember in moments long past
most dear to my sight was the spring's opening bloom
but then my youth's spring sorrow had not o'ercast
nor taught me with fondness to look on the tomb
fair spring now no longer these grieffaded eyes
thy rich glowing beauties with pleasure can see
thy pale sickly hues chilly autumn i prize
they suit blighted hopes and are emblems of me
where dost thou bide blessed soul of my love
is ether thy dwelling o whisper me where
rapt in remembrance while lonely i rove
i gaze on bright clouds and i fancy thee there
or to thy bower when musing i go
i think 't is thy voice that i hear in the breeze
softly it seems to speak peace to my woe
and life once again for a moment can please
if this be phrensy alone 't is so dear
that long may the pleasing delusion be nigh
still ellen's voice in the breeze may i hear
still see in bright clouds the kind beams of her eye
low hung the dark clouds on plinlimmon's tall peak
and slowly yet surely the winter drew near
when ellen sweet ellen a tear on her cheek
exclaimed as we parted in may i'll be here
how swiftly i ran up the mountain's steep height
to catch the last glimpse of an object so dear
and when i no longer could keep her in sight
i thought on her promise in may i'll be here
now gladly i mark from plinlimmon's tall peak
the lowhanging vapours and clouds disappear
and climb the rough mountain thence ellen to seek
repeating her promise in may i'll be here
but vainly i gaze the wide prospect around
't is may yet no ellen returning is near
oh when shall i see her when feel my heart bound
as sweetly she cries it is may and i'm here
you ask why these mountains delight me no more
and why lovely clwyd's attractions are o'er
ah have you not heard then the cause of my pain
the pride of fair clwyd the boast of the plain
we never no never shall gaze on again
what though from her coldness keen anguish i felt
and vainly to move her in agony knelt
yet could i restore her i'd never complain
not e'en though she doomed me to endless disdain
i'd bear any torture to see her again
i grieved when on others with kindness she gazed
i mourned when another with pleasure she praised
but could i recall her to life by my pain
i'd urge her to favour some happier swain
and wish no reward but to see her again
those beauties that charmed me from death i would free
though sure that those beauties another's should be
but truth and affection and grief are all vain
the pride of fair clwyd the boast of our plain
we never ah never can gaze on again
in a vale fring'd with woodland where grottos abound
and rivulets murmur and echoes resound
i vow'd to the muses my time and my care
since neither could win me the smiles of my fair
as freedom inspir'd me i rang'd and i sung
and daphne's dear name never fell from my tongue
and if once a smooth accent delighted my ear
i should wish unawares that my daphne might hear
with fairest ideas my bosom i stor'd
allusions to none but the nymph i ador'd
and the more i with study my fancy refin'd
the deeper impressions she made on my mind
ah whilst i the beauties of nature pursue
i still must my daphne's fair image renew
the graces have chosen with daphne to rove
and the muses are all in alliance with love
yes these are the scenes where with iris i stray'd
but short was her sway for so lovely a maid
in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run
in the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun
illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove
so fatal to beauty so killing to love
yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains
once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains
how many soft moments i spent in this grove
how fair was my nymph and how fervent my love
be still tho' my heart thine emotion give o'er
remember the season of love is no more
with her how i stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs
or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs
then breathless with ardor my fairone pursu'd
and to think with what kindness my garland she view'd
but be still my fond heart this emotion give o'er
fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more
ye belles and ye flirts and ye pert little things
who trip in this frolicksome round
pray tell me from whence this indecency springs
the sexes at once to confound
what means the cock'd hat and the masculine air
with each motion design'd to perplex
bright eyes were intended to languish not stare
and softness the test of your sex
the girl who on beauty depends for support
may call ev'ry art to her aid
the bosom display'd and the petticoat short
are samples she gives of her trade
but you on whom fortune indulgently smiles
and whom pride has preserv'd from the snare
should slily attack us with coyness and wiles
not with open and insolent air
the venus whose statue delights all mankind
shrinks modestly back from the view
and kindly shou'd seem by the artist design'd
to serve as a model for you
then learn with her beauties to copy her air
nor venture too much to reveal
our fancies will paint what you cover with care
and double each charm you conceal
the blushes of morn and the mildness of may
are charms which no art can procure
oh be but yourselves and our homage we pay
and your empire is solid and sure
but if amazon like you attack your gallants
and put us in fear of our lives
you may do very well for sisters and aunts
but believe me you'll never be wives
'midst beauty and pleasure's gay triumphs to languish
and droop without knowing the source of my anguish
to start from short slumbers and look for the morning
yet close my dull eyes when i see it returning
sighs sudden and frequent looks ever dejected
sounds that steal from my tongue by no meaning connected
ah say fellowswains how these symptoms befell me
they smile but reply not sure delia will tell me
thyrsis when we parted swore
ere the spring he would return
ah what means yon violet flower
and the buds that deck the thorn
'twas the lark that upward sprung
'twas the nightingale that sung
idle notes untimely green
why such unavailing haste
western gales and skies serene
prove not always winter past
cease my doubts my fears to move
spare the honour of my love
leave me simple shepherd leave me
drag no more a hopeless chain
i cannot like nor would deceive thee
love the maid that loves again
tho' more gentle nymphs surround me
kindly pitying what i feel
only you have power to wound me
sylvia only you can heal
corin cease this idle teazing
love that's forc'd is harsh and sour
if the lover be displeasing
to persist disgusts the more
'tis in vain in vain to fly me
sylvia i will still pursue
twenty thousand times deny me
i will kneel and weep anew
cupid ne'er shall make me languish
i was born averse to love
lovers' sighs and tears and anguish
mirth and pastime to me prove
still i vow with patient duty
thus to meet your proudest scorn
you for unrelenting beauty
i for constant love was born
but the fates had not consented
since they both did fickle prove
of her scorn the maid repented
and the shepherd of his love
'tis enough the hour is come
now within the silent tomb
let this mortal frame decay
mingled with its kindred clay
since thy mercies oft of old
by thy chosen seers foretold
faithful now and stedfast prove
god of truth and god of love
since at length my aged eye
sees the dayspring from on high
son of righteousness to thee
lo the nations bow the knee
and the realms of distant kings
own the healing of thy wings
those whom death had overspread
with his dark and dreary shade
lift their eyes and from afar
hail the light of jacob's star
waiting till the promis'd ray
turn their darkness into day
see the beams intensely shed
shine o'er sion's favour'd head
never may they hence remove
tho' the amorous beau
so courtly and fine
admire a dress
and face of fifteen
let orinda but speak
her tongue will surprize
and make him her slave
spight of celia's bright eyes
was she old and deform'd
her wit and her air
would conquer more hearts
than the young and the fair
those charms are more noble
the lovely and kind
may vanquish the body
she conquers the mind
i am wearing away like the snow in the sun
i am wearing away from the pain in my heart
but ne'er shall he know who my peace has undone
how bitter how lasting how deep is my smart
i know he would pity so kind is his soul
to him my affliction would agony be
but never while i can my feelings control
the youth whom i love shall know sorrow through me
though longing to weep in his presence i'll smile
call the flush of my cheek the pure crimson of health
his fears for my peace by my song i'll beguile
nor venture to gaze on his eyes but by stealth
for conscious i am by my glance is exprest
the passion that faithful as hopeless will be
and he whom alas i can ne'er render blest
shall never no never know sorrow through me
to wander alone when the moon faintly beaming
where owls seek for covert and night birds complaining
'tis not for the happy come daughter of sorrow
where lost in the past nor regarding tomorrow
spring returns the flowrets blow
will hope return ah no ah no
with the dreams of youth she flies
and like the rose her emblem dies
fancy droops beneath the shade
and all the gay delights are fled
grief and mis'ry hence away
this is nina's wedding day
all her sorrows now are past
may her joys for ever last
joy attend this happy pair
he is brave as she is fair
guarded by the god of love
may they ever constant prove
how easy was colin how blithe and how gay
ere he met the fair chloris how sprightly his lay
so graceful her form so accomplish'd her mind
sure pity he thought with such charms must be join'd
whenever she danc'd or whenever she sung
how just was her motion how sweet was her tongue
and when the youth told her his passionate flame
she allow'd him to fancy her heart felt the same
with ardour he press'd her to think him sincere
but alas she redoubled each hope and each fear
she would not deny nor she would not approve
and she neither refus'd him nor gave him her love
now cheer'd by complacence now froze by disdain
he languish'd for freedom but languish'd in vain
'till thyrsis who pity'd so helpless a slave
eas'd his heart of its pain by the counsel he gave
forsake her said he and reject her awhile
if she love you she soon will return with a smile
you can judge of her passion by absence alone
and by absence will conquer her heart or your own
this advice he pursu'd but the remedy prov'd
too fatal alas to the fair one he lov'd
which cur'd his own passion but left her in vain
to sigh for a heart she could never regain
quickly delia learn my passion
lose not pleasure to be proud
courtship draws on observation
and the whispers of the croud
soon or late you'll hear a lover
nor by time his truth can prove
ages won't a heart discover
trust and so secure my love
when the nymphs were contending for beauty and fame
fair sylvia stood foremost in right of her claim
when to crown the high transports dear conquest excites
at court she was envy'd and toasted at white's
but how shall i whisper this fair one's sad case
a cruel disease has spoil'd her sweet face
her vermillion is chang'd to a dull settled red
and all the gay graces of beauty are fled
yet take heed all ye fair how you triumph in vain
for sylvia tho' alter'd from pretty to plain
is now more engaging fince reason took place
than when she possess'd the perfections of face
convinc'd she no more can coquet it and teaze
instead of tormenting she studies to please
makes truth and discretion the guide of her life
and tho' spoil'd for a toast she's well form'd for a wife
he's gone the bright way that his honour directs him
oh all ye kind powers let me beg you protect him
he's gone my dear and left me here mourning
but hang these dull thoughts i'le fancy him returning
returning i'le think the great hero victorious
with joy to my arms as faithful as glorious
against his bright eyes i am sure there's no standing
he looks like a god and moves as commanding
with a face so angelick the foe will be charmed
the conquest were his tho he met'em disarm'd
they could not be sure of a rational nature
that wou'd not relent at so moving a feature
venus disguis'd he'el be thought by his beauty
and spar'd from the sense of a generous duty
yet when i reflect on the wounded and dying
in spight of my courage it sets me a sighing
but the resolute brave no danger can stay him
tho' i us'd all my charms and arts to delay him
yet oh ye kind powers you are bound to protect him
since he'es gone the bright way that glory directs him
ye scenes that engag'd my gay youth
say whither so fast do ye fly
if the lesson you told me was truth
ah why do ye fade from my eye
that meadow where often i stray'd
that bank and yon shadowy tree
those streams with such fondness survey'd
have hid all their sweetness from me
yon hill that uprears his smooth head
where the wildthyme its fragrance bestows
whose verdures have rose from my bed
and whose breezes have sigh'd my repose
what tho' from his summit so high
flock cottage and woodland are seen
yet no more i with fondness descry
for indifference rises between
ah whither ye sweets do ye fly
for fancy your absence must mourn
ah say will ye fade from my eye
and yet will ye never return
that valley whose mantle so gay
is with primrose and cowslip o'erspread
no longer invites me to stray
and rifle the sweets of their bed
not odious at present they look
i discern that their colours are bright
but their charms have my fancy forsook
and their fragrance forgot to delight
to my cooler attention how dear
the soothing complaint of the dove
i have left my companions to hear
the woodlinnet warble her love
nor these can my footsteps retard
or if round me they carelessly fly
from mine eyes they attract no regard
and my ears their soft warblings deny
ah sure 'tis the bus'ness of life
that bids those endearments depart
to involve us in cares and in strife
that estrange and entangle the heart
with destiny all must comply
yet cannot my fancy but mourn
for the season that fades from my eye
and the sweets that must never return
now evening had tinged the gay landskip with gold
the swains were retired and their flocks in the fold
when delia complain'd in the woodland alone
loud ecchoes retain'd and replied to her moan
the warblers sat listening around on the spray
and the gale stole in murmurs as soft as her lay
ah my strephon twas thus the fair mourner begun
how cruel to leave me thus lost and undone
your vows like the wind you forget or despise
you slight my complaints and are deaf to my cries
the frown once so dreadful ah where is its power
the voice heard with transport gives transport no more
though the sylvans to please me exert all their powers
though the swains crown my head with a garland of flowers
though they swear that my eyes like the morning are gay
that my song is more sweet than the nightingales lay
yet while strephon is absent dejected dismay'd
i droop like a flower that repines in the shade
o return gentle shepherd return to my prayer
ah think how i sigh in unpitied despair
but in vain all my hopes all my wishes are vain
while the streams and the breezes thus hear me complain
while the birds to my anguish reply from the bough
he flies from my arms and regards not my woe
ah too easy to trust all the oaths that he swore
when he vow'd that no nymph had e'er charm'd him before
be warn'd then ye fair nor too rashly believe
think the men when they flatter but want to deceive
that the fond easy promise was ne'er meant to bind
and believe when they swear that their oaths are all wind
shall pope sing his flames
with quality dames
and dutchesses toast when he dines
shall swift ballads compose
on the girls at the rose
whilst unsung is my fair charlotte lynes
o were phoebus my friend
or would bacchus but lend
me the spirits that flow from his wines
the lass of the mill
molly mogg and lepell
shou'd be dowdies to fair charlotte lynes
the astronomer cries
look up to yon skies
and view the bright heavenly signs
for a sight brighter far
than sun moon or star
let him look at my fair charlotte lynes
the miser for gain
thinks nothing of pain
and contentedly digs in the mines
let him take all peru
and rich mexico too
what are these to my fair charlotte lynes
any porter may serve
for a copy to carve
an alcides with muscular chines
but a venus to draw
bright as eye ever saw
he must copy my fair charlotte lynes
the favourite child
whom her fondness has spoil'd
for mamma often whimpers and whines
and this hour let me die
but i languish and sigh
when i'm absent from fair charlotte lynes
for quadrille when the fair
cards and counters prepare
they cast out the tens eights and nines
and in love 'tis my fear
the like fate i shall share
discarded by fair charlotte lynes
astrologers prove
the conjunctions above
with their houses squares circles and signs
but oh could they show
one conjunction below
between me and my fair charlotte lynes
with hearts full of rapture
our good dean and chapter
count over and finger their fines
but i'd give their estate
was it ten times as great
for one kiss from my fair charlotte lynes
in the midst of gay sights
and foreign delights
for his country the banish'd man pines
thus from her when away
tho' my eyes they may stray
yet my heart is with fair charlotte lynes
antiquity's page
the rev'rend sage
explains from old medals and coins
but no comment so fit
on youth beauty and wit
can they find as my fair charlotte lynes
it is atropos' sport
with her sheers to cut short
the thread which dame lachesis twines
but forbear you curst jade
or cut mine not the thread
that was spun for my fair charlotte lynes
the young pair for a crown
on his book paid him down
the sacrist obsequiously joins
was i bishop i swear
i'd resign him my chair
to unite me with fair charlotte lynes
for my first night i'd go
to those regions of snow
where the sun for six months never shines
and oh there shou'd complain
he too soon came again
to disturb me with fair charlotte lynes
the pastures the sheep
shall exchange for the deep
and mackrel shall grow on the vines
the sun shall burn blue
ere my heart proves untrue
or forgets to love fair charlotte lynes
how pleasant is love
when forbid or unknown
was my passion approv'd
it would quickly be gone
it adds to the charms
when we steal the delight
why should love be expos'd
since himself has no sight
in some silvan shade
let me sigh for my swain
where none but an eccho
will speak on't again
thus silent and soft
i'll pass the time on
and when i grow weary
i'll make my love known
when approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of spring
swelling buds open first and look gay
when the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing
and are danc'd by the breeze on each spray
when gently descending the rain in soft showers
with its moisture refreshes the ground
and the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers
like rich gems beam a lustre around
when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe
and the cuckow proclaims with his voice
that nature marks this for the season to wooe
and for all that can love to rejoice
in a cottage at night may i spend all my time
in the fields and the meadows all day
with a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime
young as april and blooming as may
when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn
may my fairest and i sweetly wake
view the far distant hills which the sun beams adorn
then arise and our cottage forsake
when the sun shines so warm that my charmer and i
may recline on the turf without fear
let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy
while we breathe the first sweets of the year
be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side
bubble out and transparently flow
creep gently along in meanders and glide
thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below
while the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips
and the violets their sweetness impart
let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips
the rich cordial that thrills to the heart
while the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate
which the fowler has caught in his snares
may we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate
to endure such an absence as theirs
may i listen to all her soft tender sweet notes
when she sings and no sounds interfere
but the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats
are at strife to be louder than her
when the daisies and cowslips and primroses blow
and checquer the meads and the lawns
may we see bounding there the swift lightfooted doe
and pursue with our eye the young fawns
when the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run
and the sirstlings are all at their play
and the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun
let us then be as frolic as they
when i talk of my love should i chance to espy
that she seems to mistrust what i say
by a tear that is ready to fall from her eye
with my lips let me wipe it away
if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes
and let no single beauty escape
but see none to create so much love and surprize
as her eyes and her face and her shape
thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves
and the meadows around us are mown
when the lass on the sweetsmelling haycock receives
what she afterwards blushes to own
when evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads
with the dew then no longer we'll roam
with my arm round her waist in a path thro' the meads
let us hasten to find our way home
when the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings
each one by the side of its mate
when a mist that arises a drowsiness brings
upon all but the owl and the bat
when soft rest is requir'd and the stars lend their light
and all nature lies quiet and still
when no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night
but at distance the clack of a mill
with peace for our pillow and free from all noise
so that voices in whispers are known
let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys
that are mus'd on by lovers alone
fairy minstrels haste away
here attune the pensive lay
where these roses crown the sod
avonia's bard awaits his god
though avon's stream for ever flow
so sweet a bard it ne'er shall know
child of nature void of art
how he knew the human heart
when the magic shell he strung
echo glad responsive sung
whilst the cowslip's fairy train
lightly trod the daisy'd plain
and still at fall of dewy night
by the moon's uncertain light
whilst they move to airs divine
round his tomb they sweetly twine
where the light cannot pierce in a grove of all trees
with my fair one as blooming as may
undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze
let me pass the hot noon of the day
when the sun less intense to the westward inclines
for the meadows the groves we'll forsake
and see the rays dance as inverted he shines
on the face of some river or lake
where my fairest and i on its verge as we pass
for 'tis she that must still be my theme
our two shadows may view on the watery glass
while the fish are at play in the stream
may the herds cease to lowe and the lambkins to bleat
when she sings me some amorous strain
all be silent and husht unless echo repeat
the kind words and sweet sounds back again
and when we return to our cottage at night
hand in hand as we sauntering stray
let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light
just direct us and chequer our way
let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk
as thus gently and slowly we move
and let no single thought be express'd in our talk
but of friendship improv'd into love
thus enchanted each day with these rural delights
and secure from ambition's alarms
soft love and repose shall divide all our nights
and each morning shall rise with new charms
by a prattling stream on a midsummer's eve
where the woodbine and jess'mine their boughs interweave
fair flora i cry'd to my arbour repair
for i must have a chaplet for sweet william's hair
she brought me the vi'let that grows on the hill
the vale dwelling lilly and gilded jonquill
but such languid odours how cou'd i approve
just warm from the lips of the lad that i love
she brought me his faith and his truth to display
the undying myrtle and evergreen bay
but why these to me who've his constancy known
and billy has laurels enough of his own
the next was a gift that i could not contemn
for she brought me two roses that grew on a stem
of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confest
so i kiss'd 'em and press'd 'em quite close to my breast
she brought me a sunflow'r this fair one's your due
for it once was a maiden and lovesick like you
oh give it me quick to my shepherd i'll run
as true to his flame as this flow'r to the sun
dame venus a daughter of jove's
and amongst all his daughters most fair
lost it seems t' other day the two doves
that wafted her car thro' the air
the dame made a heavy sad rout
ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em
and sought high and low to find out
where the biddyes were stray'd or who stole 'em
to the god who the stragglers shou'd meet
she promis'd most tempting fine pay
six kisses than honey more sweet
and a seventh far sweeter than they
the proposal no sooner was made
but it put all the gods in a flame
for who would not give all he had
to be kiss'd by so dainty a dame
to cyprus to paphos they run
where the goddess oft us'd to retire
some rode round the world with the sun
and search'd every country and shire
but with all their hard running and riding
not a god of 'em claim'd the reward
for no one could tell tale or tiding
if the doves were alive or were starv'd
at last the sly shooter of men
young cupid i beg the god's pardon
mamma your blue birds i have seen
in a certain terrestrial garden
where where my dear child quickly shew
quoth the dame almost out of her wits
do but go to chlorinda's says cu
and you'll find 'em in shape of pewits
is it she that hath done me this wrong
full well i know her and her arts
she has follow'd the thieving trade long
but i thought she dealt only in hearts
i shall soon make her know so i shall
and with that to jove's palace she run
and began like a bedlam to bawl
i am cheated i'm robb'd i'm undone
chlorinda whom none can approach
without losing his heart or his senses
has stol'n the two doves from my coach
and now flaunts it at venus' expences
she has chang'd the poor things to pewits
and keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls
so when she robs men of their wits
she turns 'em to asses or owls
i cou'd tell you of many a hundred
of figure high station and means
whom she without mercy has plunder'd
ever since she came into her teens
but her thefts upon earth i'd have borne
or have let 'em all pass for mere fable
but nothing will now serve her turn
but the doves out of venus's stable
is it fit let your mighty ship say
that i like some pitiful flirt
shou'd tarry within doors all day
or else trudge it afoot in the dirt
is it fit that a mortal shou'd trample
on me who am styl'd queen of beauty
o make her great jove an example
and teach nimblefingers her duty
sir jove when he heard her thus rage
for all his great gravity smil'd
and then like a judge wise and sage
he began in terms sober and mild
learn daughter to bridle your tongue
forbear to traduce with your prattle
the fair who has done you no wrong
and scorns to purloin goods and chattel
she needs neither gewgaw nor trinket
to carry the world all before her
her deserts i wou'd have you to think it
are enough to make all men adore her
your doves are elop'd i confess
and chuse with chlorinda to dwell
but blame not the lady for this
for sure 'tis no crime to excel
as for them i applaud their high aims
having serv'd from the time of their birth
the fairest of heavenly dames
they would now serve the fairest on earth
though bacchus may boast of his carekilling bowl
such worship alas has no charms for the soul
to the arrow of fate or the canker of care
but to fancy that feeds on the charms of the fair
what soul that's possess'd of a dream so divine
for the tear that bedews sensibility's shrine
the tender excess which enamours the heart
of those exquisite feelings that please tho' we smart
each change and excess have thro' life been my doom
the bottle affords us a glimpse through the gloom
come then rosy venus and spread o'er my sight
awake in my breast the soft dream of delight
then deep will i drink of the nectar divine
each throb of my heart shall accord with the wine
and now my gay comrades the myrtle and vine
let reason not riot the garland entwine
fairest flow'r all flow'rs excelling
which in eden's garden grew
flow'rs of eve's' imbower'd dwellinga
are my fairone types of you
mark my polly how the roses
emulate thy damask cheek
how the bud its sweets discloses
buds thy opening bloom bespeak
lilies are by plain direction
emblems of a double kind
emblems of thy fair complexion
emblems of thy fairer mind
but dear girl both flow'rs and beauty
blossom fade and die away
then pursue good sense and duty
evergreens that ne'er decay
i hope sir by this you have found your account
in visiting airy and seeing his mount
if froth can delight you you're wonderous happy
and we know it gives joy on a bottle of nappy
your friend would be very much mended in troth
should airy bestow him a dash of his froth
to keep up the metaphor 'twould make him mellow
and of a sour stoic a pleasant young fellow
and airy be recompens'd well for that favour
if your friend in return should make him grow graver
this exchange should they make it would set 'em both right
since one is too solid and t'other too light
prythee why so fantastick and vain
what charms can the toilet supply
why so studious admirers to gain
need beauty lay traps for the eye
because that thy breast is so fair
must thy tucker be still setting right
and canst thou not laughing forbear
because that thy teeth are so white
shall sovereign beauty descend
to act so ignoble a part
whole hours at the lookingglass spend
a slave to the dictates of art
and cannot thy heart be at rest
unless thou excellest each fair
in trinkets and trumpery dress'd
is not that a superfluous care
vain idle attempt to pretend
the lilly with whiteness to deck
does the rich solitaire recommend
the delicate turn of thy neck
the glossy bright hue of thy hair
can powder or jewels adorn
can perfumes or vermilions compare
with the breath or the blush of the morn
when embarrass'd with baubles and toys
thou'rt set out so enormously fine
overdoing thy purpose destroys
and to please thou hast too much design
little know'st thou how beauty beguiles
how alluring the innocent eye
what sweetness in natural smiles
and what charms in simplicity lye
thee nature with beauty has clad
with genuine ornaments dress'd
nor can art an embellishment add
to set off what already is best
be it thine selfaccomplish'd to reign
bid the toilet be far set apart
and dismiss with an honest disdain
that impertinent abigail art
say sad tenant of the grove
whence the pains that now you prove
why within your throbbing breast
why is sorrow still a guest
sleeps in death your murder'd mate
weep'st thou his melancholy fate
if 'tis that disturbs thy peace
spring shall bid thy sorrows cease
then thy breast that heaves in woe
with love's bright flame again shall glow
yet sweet mourner still complain
nor though bless'd forbear thy strain
for sweetly sad thy warblings flow
and charming is thy song of woe
as at eve he treads the plain
oft it soothes the shepherd swain
when he seeks the conscious shade
there to meet the village maid
he with rapture hears thy lay
issue from the hawthorn spray
and with mine unites his praise
of philomela's tender lays
the minutes the hours the days and the years
that fill up the current of time
neither flowing with hopes neither ebbing with fears
unheeded roll'd on to my prime
in infancy prattling in youth full of play
still pleas'd with whatever was new
i bad the old cripple fly swifter away
to o'ertake some gay trifle in view
but when chloe with sweetness and sense in her look
first taught me the lesson of love
then i counted each step the wing'd fugitive took
and bad him more leisurely move
stop runaway stop nor thy journey pursue
for chloe has gi'en me her heart
to enjoy it thy years will prove many too few
if you make so much haste to depart
still still he flies on still still let him fly
'till he's tired and panting for breath
my love both his teeth and his scythe shall defy
that can only be conquer'd by death
happy verses that were prest
in fair ethelinda's breast
happy muse that didst embrace
the sweet the heav'nlyfragrant place
tell me is the omen true
shall the bard arrive there too
oft thro' my eyes my soul has flown
and wanton'd on that ivory throne
there with extatic transport burn'd
and thought it was to heav'n return'd
shall the body follow too
when first at nature's early birth
heav'n sent a man upon the earth
ev'n eden was more fruitful found
when adam came to till the ground
shall then those breasts be fair in vain
and only rise to fall again
no no fair nymph for no such end
did heav'n to thee its bounty lend
that breast was ne'er design'd by fate
for verse or things inanimate
then throw them from that downy bed
and take the poet in their stead
how i hail this morn's appearing
safety danger past endearing
fame is thine lo crowds aver it
but i charge thee don't prefer it
thou thy country's call obeying
and thy ready zeal repaying
but have i no claims my rover
yes o yes and wandering over
ha methinks thy glances reading
duty still love's claim impeding
of my fears too dread revival
yet with tearful joy i see
potent over love and me
hy would you know the passion
you have kindled in my breast
trifling is the inclination
that by words can be express'd
in my silence see the lover
true love is by silence known
in my eyes you'll best discover
all the power of your own
love's gay queen who reigns on earth
smil'd miranda at thy birth
pleas'd she bid thy angel face
beam with each bewitching grace
round your waist her zone she threw
charms divine thus giving you
cupid knelt and lowting low
to your sway resign'd his bow
jove who saw the temple fair
thron'd each human virtue there
pallas then the work to crown
made her aegis all your own
apollo of old on britannia did smile
and delphi forsook for the sake of this isle
around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays
and in every wilderness planted his bays
then chaucer and spenser harmonious were heard
then shakespear and milton and waller appear'd
and dryden whose brows by apollo were crown'd
as he sung in such strains as the god might have own'd
but now since the laurel is given of late
to cibber to eusden to shadwell and tate
apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd
and his harp and his bays to hibernia remov'd
he vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more
and has put out pope's fires which he kindled before
and further he says men no longer shall boast
a science their slight and ill treatment hath lost
but that women alone for the future shall write
and who can resist when they doubly delight
and lest we shou'd doubt what he said to be true
has begun by inspiring saphira and you
tho' the plumb and the peach with apollo conspire
to present you their softness and sweetness and fire
their aid is in vain for what can they do
but blush and confess them selves vanquish'd by you
where virtue and wit with such qualities blend
what mortal what goddess would dare to contend
can ease be consistent with state
can freedom and pomp thus agree
o stanhope who wou'd not be great
if easy in greatness like thee
let statesmen pretend to despise
those talents that furnish delight
'tis stanhope's alone to be wise
yet pleasure with wisdom unite
state burthens with form the gay soul
unbended alone we taste joy
too soon our grey hairs must controul
that bliss which our prime should employ
then stanhope be blest in your choice
be happy your life in each stage
while spirits attend you rejoice
you've wisdom enough for old age
that your honour's petitioners dealers in rhyme
and writers of scandal for mending the times
by losses in bus'ness and england's welldoing
are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin
that these their misfortunes they humbly conceive
arise not from dulness as some folks believe
but from rubs in their way that your honour has laid
and want of materials to carry on trade
that they always had form'd high conceits of their use
and meant their last breath should go out in abuse
but now and they speak it with sorrow and tears
since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs
no party will join 'em no faction invite
to heed what they say or to read what they write
sedition and tumult and discord are fled
and slander scarce ventures to lift up her head
in short publick bus'ness is so carry'd on
that their country is sav'd and the patriots undone
to perplex 'em still more and sure famine to bring
now satire has lost both its truth and its sting
if in spite of their natures they bungle at praise
your honour regards not and nobody pays
your petitioners therefore most humbly entreat
as times will allow and your honour thinks meet
that measures be chang'd and some cause of complaint
be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint
their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve
that again they may rail and the nation believe
or else if your wisdom shall deem it all one
now the parliament's rising and bus'ness is done
that your honour would please at this dangerous crisis
to take to your bosom a few private vices
by which your petitioners haply might thrive
and keep both themselves and contention alive
in compassion good sir give 'em something to say
and your honour's petitioners ever shall pray
tho' the muse had deny'd me so often before
i ventur'd this day to invoke her once more
she ask'd what i wanted i said with delight
your lordship had promis'd to sup here tonight
that on an occasion so much to my honour
i hop'd she'd excuse me for calling upon her
to this she reply'd with disdain in her looks
if that be the case go summon your cooks
i told her in answer how little you eat
that in vain i should hope to regale you with meat
that she knew wit and humour to you were a feast
who had tho' no stomach an excellent taste
this calm'd her resentment she paus'd for a while
then the goddess propitious reply'd with a smile
if with humour and wit you would have him delighted
what need i be call'd let the dean be invited
the bus'ness is done if with him you prevail
for a boyle and a swift will each other regale
to the late king of britain a savage was brought
which wild in the woods of germania was caught
this present so princely was train'd up with care
and knew how to eat and to jump and to stare
the beaux and the belles beheld it with joy
and at court the high mode was to see the wild boy
reflecting on this with a politic view
i determin'd to send such a present to you
in the wilds of hibernia this boy was beset
and caught as the natives are there in a net
the creature has sense and in my eyes is pretty
with talents to make a good man in the city
industrious and orderly prudent and smart
and not too much conscience nor too little art
not scrup'lous but honest a heart set on gain
whose highest ambition is fix'd on the chain
from you may he copy to wear it with glory
like you in return be honour'd in story
i blame all the fears i gave way to before
i say to my heart be at rest and believe
that whom once she has chosen she never will leave
but ah when i think on each ravishing grace
that plays in the smiles of that heavenly face
my heart beats again i again apprehend
some fortunate rival in every friend
these painful suspicions you cannot remove
since you neither can lessen your charms nor my love
but doubts caus'd by passion you never can blame
for they are not ill founded or you feel the same
to speed the sad moments away
which by absence seem tedious and slow
attend my dear girl to the lay
that love taught so sweetly to flow
thro' the regions of quiet and joy
as led by the muses you stray
oh think that your damon is by
and that such are the words he would say
such may be the words he might say
but what words can his passion impart
or how shall he form the soft lay
to express what he feels at his heart
tho' thy voice gentle shepherd was clear
tho' the bower of contentment was thine
yet thy shepherdess was not so fair
yet thy love was not equal to mine
how sweet to the heart is the thought of tomorrow
how sweet when we can from futurity borrow
when wearisome sickness has taught me to languish
let me hope ah how soon would it lessen my anguish
the pilgrim sojourning alone unbefriended
that at home and with care sympathetic attended
when six days of labour each other succeeding
what pleasure to think as the last is receding
and when the vain shadows of time are retiring
the christian believing exulting expiring
the infidel then sees no joyous tomorrow
poor wretch can he feel without heartrending sorrow
seek not in these paths to view
dryads green or naiads blue
such as haunt at eve or dawn
a enville's lake orb hagley's lawn
such as sport onc worfield's meads
such as shenstone's genius leads
o'er vale and hill and to their care
consigns his waves and woodlands fair
while the muses vacant stray
and echo wants her sweetest lay
long long may those unrival'd shine
nor shall my temp'rate breast repine
so music lend her willing aid
to gladden this ignoble shade
so peace endear this humble plain
and haply elegance will deign
to wander here and smiling see
her sister nymph simplicity
little inmate full of mirth
chirping on my kitchen hearth
wheresoe'er be thine abode
always harbinger of good
pay me for thy warm retreat
with a song more soft and sweet
in return thou shalt receive
such a strain as i can give
thus thy praise shall be exprest
inoffensive welcome guest
while the rat is on the scout
and the mouse with curious snout
with what vermin else infest
every dish and spoil the best
frisking thus before the fire
thou hast all thine heart's desire
though in voice and shape they be
form'd as if akin to thee
thou surpassest happier far
happiest grasshoppers that are
theirs is but a summer's song
thine endures the winter long
unimpair'd and shrill and clear
melody throughout the year
neither night nor dawn of day
puts a period to thy play
sing then and extend thy span
far beyond the date of man
wretched man whose years are spent
in repining discontent
lives not aged tho' he be
half a span compar'd with thee
owen's praise demands my song
owen swift and owen strong
fairest flower of roderic's slem
t gwyneth's shield and britain's gem
he nor heaps his brooded stores
nor on all profusely pours
lord of every regal art
liberal hand and open heart
big with hosts of mighty name
squadrons three against him came
this the force of eirin hiding
side by side as proudly riding
on her shadow long and gay
u lochlin plows the watery way
there the norman sails afar
catch the winds and join the war
black and huge along they sweep
burthens of the angry deep
dauntless on his native sands
w the dragon son of mona stands
in glittering arms and glory drest
high he rears his ruby crest
there the thundering strokes begin
there the press and there the din
talymalfra's rocky shore
echoing to the battle's roar
where his glowing eyeballs turn
thousand banners round him burn
where he points his purple spear
hasty hasty rout is there
marking with indignant eye
fear to stop and shame to fly
there confusion terror's child
conflict fierce and ruin wild
agony that pants for breath
despair and honourable death
fairest flower of roderic's stem
gwyneth's shield and britain's gem
lochlin ploughs the watery way
the dragonson of mona stands
in glittering arms and glory dressed
when colin's good dame who long held him a tug
and defeated his hopes by the help of the jug
had taken too freely the cheeruping cup
and repeated the dose till it laid her quite up
colin sent for the doctor with sorrowful face
he gave him his fee and he told him her case
quoth galen i'll do what i can for your wife
but indeed she's so bad that i fear for her life
in counsel there's safety e'en send for another
for if she shou'd die folks will make a strange pother
and say that i lost her for want of good skill
or of better advice or in short what they will
says colin your judgment there's none can dispute
and if physic can cure her i know yours will do't
but if after all she shou'd happen to die
and they say that you kill'd her i'll swear 'tis a lye
'tis the husband's chief business whatever ensue
and whoever finds fault i'll be shot if i do
the slightest of favours bestow'd by the fair
with rapture we take and with transport we wear
but a mosswoven rosebud eliza from thee
a wellpleasing gift to a monarch would be
ah that illness too cruel forbidding should stand
and refuse me the gift from thine own lovely hand
with joy i receive it with pleasure will view
reminded of thee by its odour and hue
sweet rose let me tell thee tho' charming thy bloom
tho' thy fragrance exceeds saba's richest perfume
thy breath to eliza's hath no fragrance in't
and thy bloom is but dull to her cheeks blushing tint
yet alas my fair flower that bloom will decay
and all thy fine beauties soon wither away
tho' pluck'd by her hand to whose touch thou must own
harsh and rough is the cygnet's most delicate down
thou too snowy hand nay i mean not to preach
but the rose lovely moralist suffer to teach
extol not fond maiden thy beauties o'er mine
they too are shortliv'd and they too must decline
and small in conclusion the difference appears
in the bloom of few days or the bloom of few years
but remember a virtue the rose hath to boast
its fragrance remains when its beauties are lost
kind companion of my youth
lov'd for genius worth and truth
take what friendship can impart
tribute of a feeling heart
take the muse's latest spark
ere we drop into the dark
he who parts and virtue gave
bade thee look beyond the grave
genius soars and virtue guides
where the love of god presides
there's a gulph 'twixt us and god
let the gloomy path be trod
why stand shivering on the shore
why not boldly venture o'er
where unerring virtue guides
let us brave the winds and tides
safe thro' seas of doubts and fears
rides the bark which virtue steers
britons rouse to deeds of death
waste not zeal in idle breath
nor lose the harvest of your swords
in a civilwar of words
wherefore teems the shameless press
with labour'd births of emptiness
reas'nings which no facts produce
eloquence that murders use
illtim'd humour that beguiles
weeping idiots of their smiles
wit that knows but to defame
and satire that profanes the name
let th' undaunted grecian teach
the use and dignity of speech
at whose thunders nobly thrown
shrunk the man of macedon
if the storm of words must rise
let it blast our enemies
sure and nervous be it hurl'd
on the philips of the world
learn not vainly to despise
proud of edward's victories
warriors wedg'd in firm array
and navies powerful to display
their woven wings to every wind
and leave the panting foe behind
give to france the honours due
france has chiefs and statesmen too
breasts which patriotpassions feel
lovers of the commonweal
and when such the foes we brave
whether on the land or wave
greater is the pride of war
and the conquest nobler far
agincourt and cressy long
have flourish'd in immortal song
and lisping babes aspire to praise
the wonders of eliza's days
and what else of late renown
has added wreaths to britain's crown
whether on th' impetuous rhine
she bade her harness'd warriors shine
or snatch'd the dangerous palm of praise
where the sambre meets the maese
or danube rolls her watry train
or the yellowtressed mayne
thro' dettingen's immortal vale
even fontenoy could tell a tale
might modest worth ingenuous speak
to raise a blush on victory's cheek
and bid the vanquish'd wreaths display
great as on culloden's day
but glory which aspires to last
leans not meanly on the past
'tis the present now demands
british hearts and british hands
curst be he the willing slave
who doubts who lingers to be brave
curst be the coward tongue that dare
breath one accent of despair
cold as winter's icy hand
to chill the genius of the land
chiefly you who ride the deep
and bid our thunders wake or sleep
as pity leads or glory calls
monarchs of your wooden walls
midst our mingling seas and skies
rise ye blakes ye raleighs rise
let the sordid lust of gain
be banish'd from the liberal main
he who strikes the generous blow
aims it at the public foe
let glory be the guiding star
wealth and honours follow her
see she spreads her lustre wide
o'er the vast atlantic tide
constant as the solar ray
points the path and leads the way
other worlds demand your care
other worlds to britain dear
where the foe insidious roves
o'er headlong streams and pathless groves
and justice simple laws confounds
with imaginary bounds
if protected commerce keep
her tenor o'er yon heaving deep
what have we from war to fear
commerce steels the nerves of war
heals the havock rapine makes
and new strength from conquest takes
nor less at home o deign to smile
goddess of britannia's isle
thou that from her rocks survey'st
her boundless realms the watry waste
thou that rov'st the hill and mead
where her flocks and heifers feed
thou that cheer'st the industrious swain
while he strows the pregnant grain
thou that hear'st his caroll'd vows
when th' expanded barn o'erflows
thou the bulwark of our cause
thou the guardian of our laws
sweet liberty o deign to smile
if to us indulgent heaven
nobler seeds of strength has given
nobler should the produce be
brave yet gen'rous are the free
come then all thy powers diffuse
goddess of extended views
ev'ry breast which feels thy flame
shall kindle into martial fame
'till shame shall make the coward bold
and indolence her arms unfold
ev'n avarice shall protect his hoard
and the plowshare gleam a sword
goddess all thy powers diffuse
and thou genuine british muse
nurs'd amid stthe druids old
where deva's wizard waters roll'd
thou that bear'st the golden key
to unlock eternity
summon thy poetic guard
britain still has many a bard
whom when time and death shall join
t' expand the ore and stamp the coin
late posterity shall own
lineal to the muse's throne
bid them leave th' inglorious theme
of fabled shade or haunted stream
in the daisypainted mead
'tis to peace we tune the reed
but when war's tremendous roar
shakes the isle from shore to shore
every bard of purer fire
tyrtaeuslike should grasp the lyre
wake with verse the hardy deed
or in the generous strife like sidney bleed
now the moonbeam's trembling lustre
silvers o'er the dewy green
and in soft and shadowy colours
sweetly paints the checquer'd scene
here between the opening branches
streams a flood of soften'd light
there the thick and twisted foliage
spreads the browner gloom of night
this is sure the haunt of fairies
in yon cool alcove they play
care can never cross the threshold
care was only made for day
far from hence be noisy clamour
sick disgust and anxious fear
pining grief and wasting anguish
never keep their vigils here
tell no tales of sheeted spectres
rising from the quiet tomb
fairer forms this cell shall visit
brighter visions gild the gloom
choral songs and sprightly voices
echo from her cell shall call
sweeter sweeter than the murmur
of the distant water fall
every ruder gust of passion
lull'd with music dies away
till within the charmed bosom
none but soft affections play
soft as when the evening breezes
gently stir the poplar grove
brighter than the smile of summer
sweeter than the breath of love
thee th' inchanted muse shall follow
lissy to the rustic cell
and each careless note repeating
tune them to her charming shell
not the muse who wreath'd with laurel
solemn stalks with tragic gait
and in clear and lofty vision
sees the future births of fate
not the maid who crown'd with cypress
sweeps along in scepter'd pall
and in sad and solemn accents
mourns the crested heroe's fall
but that other smiling sister
with the blue and laughing eye
singing in a lighter measure
strains of woodland harmony
all unknown to fame or glory
easy blith and debonair
crown'd with flowers her careless tresses
loosely floating on the air
then when next the star of evening
softly sheds the silent dew
let me in this rustic temple
lissy meet the muse and you
i am monarch of all i survey
my right there is none to dispute
from the center all round to the sea
i am lord of the fowl and the brute
oh solitude where are the charms
that sages have seen in the face
better dwell in the midst of alarms
than reign in this horrible place
i am out of humanity's reach
i must finish my journey alone
never hear the sweet music of speech
i start at the sound of my own
the beasts that roam over the plain
my form with indifference see
they are so unacquainted with man
their tameness is shocking to me
society friendship and love
divinely bestow'd upon man
oh had i the wings of a dove
how soon wou'd i taste you again
my sorrows i then might assuage
in the ways of religion and truth
might learn from the wisdom of age
and be cheer'd by the fallies of youth
religion what treasure untold
resides in that heav'nly word
more precious than silver and gold
or all that this earth can afford
but the sound of the church going bell
these vallies and rocks never heard
ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell
or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd
ye winds that have made me your sport
convey to this desolate shore
some cordial endearing report
of a land i shall visit no more
my friends do they now and then send
a wish or a thought after me
o tell me i yet have a friend
though a friend i am never to see
how fleet is a glance of the mind
compar'd with the speed of its flight
the tempest itself lags behind
and the swift winged arrows of light
when i think of my own native land
in a moment i seem to be there
but alas recollection at hand
soon hurries me back to despair
but the sea fowl is gone to her nest
the beast is laid down in his lair
ev'n here is a season of rest
and i to my cabbin repair
there is mercy in ev'ry place
and mercy encouraging thought
gives even affliction a grace
and reconciles man to his lot
i lives in a neat little cottage
on sundays i dresses me handsome
i goes to the sign of the anchor
to wait till the lads are all ready
o lozes o' me we are merry
dick spriggins he acts sae like players
and first he comes in for king richard
he wad part with his kingdom for horses
and then he comes in for young roma
i's just fit to drop whilst he's talking
o lozes o' me it is moving
and then he looks up at a window
and then he lets wit' at she's talking
but i think she caws out on squire roma
then up wi' dick spriggins for ever
may his bairns be as honest as he's been
sir walter returned from the far holy land
but such precious blood as now darkened his sword
fast fluttered his heart as his own castle towers
my wife and my son he exclaimed while his tears
for terror now whispered the wife he had left
the child he had claspt in his farewel embrace
then sighing he thought of his editha's tears
and her accents of love while she fervently cried
and then he remembered in language half formed
while scarcely he now can believe as a man
but should he not live to escape from that fear
nor stopped he again till his own castle moat
't was daybreak yet still past the windows he saw
blest sight that she lives he exclaimed with smile
for stranger to sloth and on business intent
and see through the castle all busy appear
that instant the knight by the warder was seen
and while loud blew the horn now a smile now a tear
'tis i my loved vassals the warrior exclaimed
who breathless and speechless soon rushed to his arms
and dost thou still love me he uttered when first
she tried to reply but in vain while her sobs
behold how i'm changed how i'm scarred he exclaimed
thou hast bled for thy god she replied and each scar
but where is my child he cried pale with alarm
and comes he not with you she said then some woe
what meanest thou my love when to manhood he grew
'o let me' he cried 'to the holy land go
'perchance my young arm by the cause nerved with strength
and the brave christian knights in reward of my zeal
'and think'st thou' i said 'with the son i can part
no hope not i'll add to the fears of the wife
i ceased and his head on my bosom reclined
when parting his ringlets i saw the big tears
the sight overcame me 'most loved' i exclaimed
thy mother will gladly to dry up thy tears
he kissed me he thanked me i armed him myself
so lovely he looked that the mother's fond fears
he went then how long has my warrior been gone
indeed then he scarcely could reach the far land
i told him my walter what armour was yours
in hopes of your meeting alas he returned
a friend whom i loved from the dawning of youth
fell fighting beside me and thus he exclaimed
'and must i then die ere the flag of the cross
but grant me loved walter this dying request
'my armour well tried and my falchion my shield
't would sooth me to know when the victory comes on
i granted his wish and his arms i assumed
and marked with delight that his last closing look
yet now this remembrance so dear to my heart
since but for this change on the field of the fight
but if he has fought and has fallen my love
a fear so illfounded if alfred had died
yet vainly he strove by the father's proud hopes
he feared for the life of his boy though with smiles
and more and more forced grew the smile on his lip
at length he exclaimed from the field of renown
i grieve that i won it a saracen chief
when lo as i claimed him my prisoner and prize
'i'm new to the battle' he cried 'and this prize
nor will i the conquest resign but with life
his daring enraged me for mine seemed the stroke
besides from his bosom depended no cross
but surely my walter the daring bespoke
so many your laurels that one you could spare
no editha no martial pride steeled my heart
he fought like a hero but vainly he fought
o illfated youth how i bleed for his fate
had armed him and blest him and prays for his life
but never again shall he gladden her eyes
o walter i tremble lest you in return
say did not the cross when your victim he fell
that symbol of him full of meekness and love
yes pity shame penitence seized on my soul
methought as he lay and in agony groaned
his casque i unlaced and i chafed his cold brow
so young and so lovely he seemed that i wept
he saw my distress and his last dying grasp
and then with a look i shall never forget
but what's this memorial with cheek deadly pale
this scarf from his bosom he uttered no more
ah then in her danger her pale look of death
o father accurst she exclaimed in that youth
we've hed sec a durdum at gobbleston parish
we'd slack reape and tight reape and dogs that wer dancin
a leytle black messet danc'd sae leyke auld jenny
it was last thing at neet and the first i' the mworning

oh venus perserv'd was the neame o' the actin

wey ned man thou luiks sae downhearted
for sixpence thy jean and thee's parted
there's lasses enow i'll uphod te
tou knows there's still fish i' the river
nay joe tou kens nought o' the matter
auld england's gown's worn till a tatter
true liberty never can flourish
till we tek a tithe pig frae the bishop
what ned and is this aw that ails thee
what tek a bit lan frae its owner
tou ploughs and tou sows and tou reaps man
nowther king lword nor bishop dar touch thee
how can tou say sae joe tou kens now
i durstn't fell yen for my life man
while girt fwok they ride down my hedges
nought but ill words i get for my damage
why there i mun own the shoe pinches
ne'er ak there's nae hard laws in england
man were we aw equal at mwornin
some arms are fur stranger than others
tou coudn't mend laws an' tou wad man
lord help te sud beggars yence rule us
what is't then but law that stands by us
and as to being parfet and parfet
when home we return after youth has been spending
and many a slow year has been wasting and ending
we often seem lost in the once wellknown places
and sigh to find age has so furrow'd dear faces
for the rose that has faded the eye still keeps mourning
and weeps every change that it sees on returning
should we miss but a tree where we us'd to be playing
or find the wood cut where we saunter'd amaying
if the yewseat's away or the ivy's awanting
we hate the fine lawn and the newfashion'd planting
each thing call'd improvement seems blacken'd with crimes
if it tears up one record of blissful old times
when many a spring had call'd forth the sweet flowers
and many an autumn had painted the bowers
i came to the place where life had its beginning
taking root with the groves that around me were springing
when i found them all gone 'twas like dear friends departed
and i walk'd where they us'd to be half broken hearted
when distant one bower my fancy still haunted
'twas hung round with woodbine my jessy had planted
i ran to the spot where a weak flower remaining
could just nod its head to approve my complaining
a tear for a dewdrop i hid in its fringes
and sigh'd then to think what one's pleasures unhinges
but ah what is that to the friends oft estranging
their manners still more than their looks daily changing
where the heart us'd to warm to find civil behaviour
make us wish we had stay'd from our country for ever
with the sweet days of youth in our fancies still glowing
and the love of old friends with old time ever growing
when severest foes impending
unexpected joys attending
though to fortune's frowns subjected
servile souls are soon dejected
prithee friend why then so serious
melancholy grows imperious
be it business love or sorrow
bid them call again tomorrow
when the soft tear steals silently down from the eye
take no note of its course nor detect the slow sigh
from some spring of shy sorrow its origin flows
some tender remembrance that weeps as it goes
ah it is not to say what will bring to the mind
the sweet joys departed the friends left behind
a tune or a song or the time of the year
strikes the key of reflection and moans in the ear
thro' the gay scenes of youth the remembrancer strays
till mem'ry steps back on old pleasures to gaze
fleeting shadows they seem that glide calmly away
the remains of past hours and the ghosts of a day
when we set out in life every thing has its charms
enkindles the fancy and all the heart warms
'tis this makes us look on the joys that are past
with an eye that turns coolly to glance on the last
let the tear then flow on nor mark the full eye
'tis the soul's secret off'ring no mortal should spy
few hearts are prepar'd for a rite so divine
when the feelings alone sacrifice at the shrine
when the sunbeams of joy gild the morn of our days
and the soft heart is warm'd both with hope and with praise
new pleasures new prospects still burst on the view
and the phantom of bliss in our walks we pursue
what tho' tangl'd in brakes or withheld by the thorn
such sorrows of youth are but pearls of the morn
as they gem the light leaf in the fervour of day
the warmth of the season dissolves them away
in the noontide of life though not robb'd of their fire
the warm wishes abate and the spirits retire
thus pictures less glowing give equal delight
when reason just tints them with shades of the night
reflection's slow shadow steals down the gay hill
though as yet you may shun the soft shade as you will
and on hope fix your eye till the brightness so clear
shall hang on its lid a dim trembling tear
next the shades of mild evening close gently around
and lengthen'd reflection must stalk o'er the ground
through her lantern of magic past pleasures are seen
and we then only know what our daydreams have been
on the painted illusion we gaze while we can
though we often exclaim what a bauble is man
in youth but a gewgaw in age but a toy
the same empty trifle as man and as boy
what nature alas has denied
to the delicate growth of our isle
art has in a measure supplied
and winter is deck'd with a smile
see mary what beauties i bring
from the shelter of that sunny shed
where the flow'rs have the charms of the spring
though abroad they are frozen and dead
'tis a bow'r of arcadian sweets
where flora is still in her prime
a fortress to which she retreats
from the cruel assaults of the clime
while earth wears a mantle of snow
these pinks are as fresh and as gay
as the fairest and sweetest that blow
on the beautiful bosom of may
see how thcy have safely surviv'd
the frowns of a sky so severe
such mary's true love that has liv'd
through many a turbulent year
the charms of the late blowing rose
seem grac'd with a livelier hue
and the winter of sorrow best shows
the truth of a friend such as you
when the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen
and the meadows their beauty have lost
when nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green
and the streams are fast bound with the frost
while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold
as bleak the winds northerly blow
and the innocent flocks run for warmth to the fold
with their fleeces besprinkled with snow
in the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw
and they send forth their breath like a steam
and the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw
flakes of ice that she finds in the cream
when the sweet countrymaiden as fresh as a rose
as she carelessly trips often slides
and the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shews
all the charms that her modesty hides
when the lads and the lasses for company join'd
in a croud round the embers are met
talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind
and of ghosts till they're all in a sweat
heaven grant in this season it may be my lot
with the nymph whom i love and admire
while the icicles hang from the eves of my cot
i may thither in safety retire
where in neatness and quiet and free from surprize
we may live and no hardships endure
nor feel any turbulent passions arise
but such as each other may cure
should i e'er become parson for so i'm inclin'd
may i get a snug benefice pat to my mind
large enough to allow of a wife at my table
a cow in my yard and a nag in my stable
may my flock n'er embroil me in quarrels and strife
in good humour i'd live all the days of my life
and die before tir'd of myself or my wife
with a friend or two near me of equal degree
as like me in all things as pea is to pea
on a pudding and joint who contented can dine
with a glass of old port and october divine
may my offerings and tythes make me always appear
with a clean tho' coarse shirt ev'ry day in the year
for of all living things not excepting a swine
the beastliest of beasts is a beastly divine
may i ne'er grow too grave not to join in the fun
when my lord cracks a joke or the squire cuts a pun
for if life is a jest as the wisest have spoke
he lives the best life then who cuts the best joke
with no mystical learning i'd trouble my head
relying on faith which will do in its stead
with knowledge enough heaven's gates to unlock
and to take the strait road there along with my flock
with a bottle or two of prime wine on my shelf
to recur to whene'er i am tir'd of myself
and a good natur'd muse to retire to at leisure
who will wrap me in rhimes and inspire me with measure
to enjoy what i have without wishing for more
for contentment with little is doubling one's store
and when i am gone may my successor say
he's gone and i wish i could live the same way
for his flock ne'er embroil'd him in quarrels or strife
in good humour he liv'd all the days of his life
and died before tir'd of himself or his wife
all i ask of bounteous heav'n
in a cottage sweet retirement
far from town and all its vices
passing all my days serenely
far from ball and masquerade
far from courtly pomp and fashion
distant from the madding croud
quitting smoak for silver fountains
ease and comfort peace and plenty
every joy that can be wish'd for
with the lark each morn arising
but contentment sweet possessing
each new day my maker praising
thanking heav'n for ev'ry blessing
one thing more i ask of heaven
one whose heart is ever constant
blest with judgment sound and clear
not the clown or foolish coxcomb
gentle as the evening breezes
fresher than the summer morning
smart and witty mild in manners
free from flatt'ry pride and folly
i desire not pow'r or riches
they are not the joys i wish for
we of late had a terrible rout in our house
if i happen'd to speak i was sure of a souse
my mamma had the toothach and i felt the smart
o steel i for ever will value thy art
both children and servants to thee are beholden
let them do what they would they were sure of a scolding
athenians i humbly beseech you explain
why the tongue cannot rest when the teeth are in pain
the death song
written for and adapted to an original indian air
the sun sets in night and the stars shun the day
but glory remains when their lights fade away
begin you tormentors your threats are in vain
for the son of alknomook will never complain
remember the arrows he shot from his bow
remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low
why so slow do you wait till i shrink from the pain
no the son of alknomook shall never complain
remember the wood where in ambush we lay
and the scalps which we bore from your nation away
now the flame rises fast you exult in my pain
but the son of alknomook can never complain
i go to the land where my father is gone
his ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son
death comes like a friend to relieve me from pain
and thy son o alknomook has scorn'd to complain
come to me and put thine sweet eyes
to put slander within my mind
of the old and bad trite stale kind
what false lines do impinge thy name
the well known lord and lady blare
such words i will not yea believe
since without gens how they deceive
the hot fire of this flames flambeau
will burn scurrilous page i know
then with glaive on this pole ill take
their head clean off for they names sake
i recall to our life when she came
and for long years few knew who she was
two decades and more still theres oerload
of mega bits and bytes thrown to us
and what a contradiction it is
no one has refrained from sharing views
and i oft feel ignorance is zen
but today it might drown us in doubt
time there was when it seemed our asset
such is shy maidens felicity
but mired with opinions dressed as lie
so enchanted was sun by queen sea
as he sat near some clouds high above
he began sliding down stealthily
till he touched the dark face of his love
then a third lover looked on the face
rosy heavens with deep purple lace
night embraced lovely sea sun was gone
such poor plight how can forever conceal
who will write future in black and white
this surveyed
in solitude
i must look very deep in my soul
that will help me get close to my goal
clear i see as a child i was free
brought to church i was taught god to love
down a path that would lead to above
for my heart and my soul lived for god
knowing he was my staff and my rod
now my hate strongly started to burn
all this hate in me screamed set me free
i am saved by his grace every day
im at peace and my spirit is free
free to fly with these wings god gave me
i will dread octobers spell
it only comes but once a year
but mummys cell phone gets a tweet
she gets unraveled in the sheets
and from the gauze that trips her feet
ghouls in shadows want to play
does he stand a ghost of chance
to take her to the midnight dance
our cat has groomed her black coat sleek
then hops upon the fence to sneak
a peek into the living room
where dad weaves magic like a goon
embarrassed is a family clan
they toss his magic in the can
a wartnosed witch gets on her broom
but preteen feet cant fly or zoom
until she cleans her messy room
the bedrooms cleaned with spit and shine
while brother dares to take his time
he plans to fill his sisters bag
with tasty toads and wormy slime
i hide and dread the harvest moon
all hollows eve is coming soon
i thought id write some poetry
just for the fun that it would be
so i went to the web to see
what it said
about how to write poems just for me
i ran into words like iambic and tercet
and other ones that i had never met
there was even a thing called a quatrain
that confused and corrupted my brain
stanzas are neat if they get the right beat
with the meter which id no doubt delete
you also have tetrameter and pentameter
which are terms i dont think are neat
long ago i did write in rhyme
but just to friends who didnt mind
id write some limericks or lyrics to sing
that were not important
and didnt mean a thing
but as i write now and look into how
i find myself stymied by words to allow
i read such things as trochee
and anapest and even dactyl
they are words i just read
and dont really feel
a measure in feet
with stresses on heavy or light
and then they repeat
they do form the meter
which makes the poem complete
i may just give up and write more in prose
my friends will give thanks and id smell like a rose
but i do get such joy with the lines in a verse
which doesnt make sense
and just makes it worse
free verse would just boggle my mind
it really wont matter
what rules i would shatter
as long as i make the words rhyme
limerick gimmerick
jason of pendleton
tried doubledactyls while
fearing the worst
uhohspaghettio
theyre all bassackwards cuz
hes used to anapest
an old goat in a boat rowed off shore
he caught perch in his search and much more
theres trout in his coat
eau de fish was his scent evermore
how they laugh and they point as they whisper bout me
and they only can see what their shallow eyes see
though my surface is not picture perfect for show
how this heart bleeds with purpose they never could know
of the horrors and trials my soul has survived
of the hell and the fury that killed me alive
ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake
made to live in a nightmare but could not awake
the atrocities bared on my face in display
oh they cause you to cringe as your eyes turn away
and the truth is my scars are much deeper than face
just a trace has been left of humanitys grace
as they came in the dead of the night whilst we slept
through the house down the hall they so silently crept
i was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust
made to watch as my daughters defiled with their lust
oh my sweet baby girls who i failed to protect
now your innocence lives in my heart where youre kept
as the flames and your screams took the last of my peace
melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release
fall the leaves of the forest tho death has yet passed
unto moonlit shadows within crypts hidden rot
oh but lo to the truth they are blind it is naught
theyre but fragmented feelings of love left aghast
from her heart they were torn bits he stabbed then forgot
the shadows cannot hide nor contain the scars wrought
left to wander until retribution is brought
as the sky bleeds to twilight the sweetest disease
as a warm breeze courts eros at twilights advance
till a feverish tango as all reason halts
as the world falls from focus in dizzying strides
should the moon cast its toxin on amorous souls
the subject at hand will be somewhat informal
i wonder each day what will be the new normal
to find some brand new locks growing out of my ear
and what of tomorrow morning when i awake
will i find a limb afflicted with a strange ache
will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill
to assuage sudden change brought on by my ill
i have chosen to find humor rather than stress
to keep our lives routine will cost us more money
to the edge of horizons and harmonys light
comes warm smiles to be found on the face of our hearts
this rapture so vibrant from the wealth of loves eyes
was released and was felt when we cut through its veils
to invite a new world to be filled with lifes needs
and claim peace from the soul with the years to be shared
to welcome the mornings when the light rushes free
and hinges on eyelids come open to adore
the lovely jewels held in the life well treasure
as we move through the days with a blissful intent
when time becomes fleeting and the days become nights
unaware of the world and the time to have passed
to spend our emotions when love found us worthy
this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss
i was lost as the night wrapped its ebony shades
round your lips like the petals on roses unfurled
left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this
though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed
so i reached for your love and i bled and i cried
as i danced through the stems of your past and your life
and was freed from my own hidden garden of pain
a poet was making such clatter
his friend ran to see whats the matter
or my poems cant be
in antiseptic pentameter
his friend laughed at all of the chatter
the other didnt grasp the matter
so your poems will be
in antipasto pentameter
my problem with glutens the matter
and why i must make so much clatter
im allergic you see
id get shakes and would be
writing in spastic pentameter
in a prayer anapestic
this form was to tick
tis the day after christmas the house is a mess
when will they restore order thats anyones guess
this familys sluggish and tired as can be
seven veggies mom will use her skills to disguise
all thats left shell transform it and serve it for days
daddy slips to the den to his favorite chair
for a short winters napthen sees mom standing there
then a big pile of invoices for us awaits
we will pay them online now is no time to doze
then up from the recliner poor pooped dad arose
i can see them but often are blurs undefined
i can see them in beauty of lifes sweet ballet
every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray
in their river of insights where artistry streams
inspiration flows from them in glorious beams
gods most beautiful creatures of angels help me
angel love and directionsunup till sundown
i cannot say how poems come to be
they come into my mind amazingly
i cannot say how i hunt down my words
or then select a form to fit the theme
or count the syllables for metered flow
select the feet of two or more to show
that make the words behave or wildly prance
to then rewrite and add what i forgot
is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold
in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly
theyll be wishes come true deep within to allot
like a resolute peace in each country on earth
find the cure for diseasestheir mysteries solved
so the curse of these monsters is truly dissolved
find a way to stop hunger both here and abroad
make new laws so that violence does not erupt
with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do
theyll be wishes come true for mankind to behold
the first child with a brother who followed in time
and my teachers took time to encourage my urge
i enjoyed my young years while i painted and penned
lots of canvas and paper used up without end
and enjoyed my new path of becoming a wife
we worked hard every day and our life was so good
i wrote poems and painted whenever i could
and i studied six years at an art gallery
i enrolled in a college to study parttime
a baand a minor in business for me
and i soon published poems of life and of heart
yet along in this time of my great writing spree
i worked hard every day as our business vp
our dear children all married with families too
are involved happily in whatever they do
and one granddaughter married two thousand thirteen
we are proud and so blessed and thank god up above
for our days and our life of good times filled with love
but to my big surprise when that contest was done
my sad eyes saw in fact that my poem had not won
could not find what it meant anywhere on the site
my head spun to fit in which of these it could be
now i still do not know what na represents
when your poem doesnt win in soup contest events
i give praise and respect to the christ
his good grace as i ask is a win
in no way does no price mean no cost
for gods mercys a gift he presents
for eternity wasted expense
the real cost for our lord was his blood
and our god sends his spirit to flood
the new life with the powr of the cross
sins a breach between man and his god
he deserves no mere shallow embrace
no believer with simply a nod
understands the full cost of his grace
does a friendship with god eer begin
jesus christ wants obedience now
than to lay down your life for your friend
we set off on excursions within that domain
we began at a loss
we embark on a most unpredictable task
touring cadillac mountain with fog as a mask
by creating a fuss
up the fiftytwo steps to attend to our need
we by chance run across
is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern
a true whatzit for us
i see fanciful lace mid inherent decay
i see whimsical bubbles entangled in play
i see change as our mood now reverses dismay
its an insight from moss
in a small grassy field
with the trees all around
theres a fairy ring ancient and old
and at times you can hear
perfect echoes of sound
tis the music of ages untold
for the crickets keep time
to a waltz or a reel
and the birds fill that lovely expanse
with the notes to a tune
in the field where the butterflies dance
where the wildflowers bloom
with a sweet perfume
in a rainbow of colours and shades
where the maids hurry down
from the hilltop town
and the butterflies dance with the maids
on a winged pirouette
or a six legged slip
and their wings flash in time
to a bright scottish trip
while the lassies turn round by the burn
where they splash in the stream
or they lie and dream
where the bullfrogs thrum
while the butterflies wing
and the hummingbirds hum
while the merry maids sing
dawn chorus trills arias in duet
not a dulcet tone morning to forget
rose shot with purl
a white wedding dress shimmers in sunlight
rose petals curl
the fresh flush of a virgin prescribed writ
the purity evident on soffit
rose throws to hurl
the serene still reflection in mirror
belie fervid brow tester an error
rose bud unfurls
the first time i heard this i was in disbelief
as he readied to play he rosined a long bow
on a hill far away the notes softly and slow
i heard voices of angels in tune through it all
through it all the strange notes woefully made demand
with small pricks of conscience from the musics tearful darts
with such lightness and patterns and passionfilled phrases
do you deign to reply just to prop up your selfpride
and takes pride in the craft of his new devotee
magnanimity faded as rivalries grew
with the confidence born of a spirit secure
many veteran artists opine to be sure
and the metrical rhythm and pacing they find
so essential to verse in traditional form
with the internal metronome setting the norm
and the imagery seen in a free verse unbound
by the strictures and structures of metrical scheme
nontraditional verse deserves no less esteem
in the end all agree that emotions the key
and the soul of the poet must yearn to be free
be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy
theres a river that twists in the mind
on crusades to the summit of rhyme
where my phoenix of tropes and schemes live
in a war to free dictions fair queen
where the soldiers of babel bemuse
and the modern day graceless regimes
are in battles to stifle my muse
in my quest for her verse of prestige
i have traveled a nexus of words
with this lexis of language on siege
where the dissonant hum drum is heard
as i pin down my thoughts in a rush
as her essence of glory i brush
shes the queen muse that whispers within
she supplies me the yarn that i spin
as she lends me her rhythm awhile
its the moment her highness is freed
that the armies of dissonance fall
and the sound of perfection can bleed
in those lyrical sounds that enthrall
i was born bronx new york in the year 'thirty nine
ten years later moved north hudson valley same state
where i've settled lived on with my loved ones to date
but when young in my school two fine talents emerged
at nineteen i then married the love of my life
to my us marine very handsome and true
paris island our home for a year almost two
by the age twenty five i was mother of three
a fine son two sweet girls a complete family
later painting with oils was the pastime for me
varied art shows displays and a job filled my time
soon i sold many pieces and life was sublime
yet the years went by fast and at age thirty nine
i enrolled in a college to study part time
six years later i earned my prized english degree
a ba and a minor in business for me
then my pictures with words replaced those done thru art
for a full twenty years we worked hard faithfully
after hubby retired as the chief of fd
selling our fire equipment all types big and small
to fds factories district schools and the malls
happy grandma of five late twenties to eighteen
we retired sold our business thirteen years ago
still so busy with life with its ebb and its flow
at the end of my rainbow
at the end of our rainbow we're so often told
at the end of my rainbow no treasure for me
at the end of my rainbow inside my own pot
will be wishes come true deep within to allot
no more conflicts or waroh just think of the mirth
to see total mankind as a genus of one
for inside we're the same from one god we do come
so the curse of these monsters be truly dissolved
with new food waste reduction plans we can applaud
revise government rules to be fair not corrupt
to respect our dear earth follow her wisdom too
at the end of my rainbow instead of bright gold
will be wishes come true for mankind to behold
god's most beautiful guardian angels come down
they descend from the heavens each one in white gown
with their spirit they guide memy heart soul and mind
these sweet gentle white angels embrace me
angels lead me are with me through my every day
i can see them in beauty of life's sweet ballet
until nighttime delivers dark sky stars and moon
i can feel them nearby when i'm writing commune
with their spirit my deep thoughts instinctively tune
and wherever i am within night or daydreams
glowing warm kindling bright for my choices to see
god's most beautiful creatures of angels help me
both when seen and when hidden they fly guarantee
and he played with a flair of beauty and motif
without breaking his stride in the garden he played
the heads bow their lips move the congregation prayed
not intending to preach someone issued the call
like a stradivari rosined strings strike their hearts
oh why not tonight played commanding those at hand
at the end the blind man with the bow cross his chair
swore he heard the soft voice seraphim singing slow
saying now find the thing that was played if you care
should you please rearrange the anagram below
after making the trip to bar harbor in maine
in the midst of events aggravating arcane
fifteen hundred feet high and sh shaking we ask
with alarm where's the bus
safely back at sea level we all need to chill
tell me who put the rest stop on top of a hill
giving vent to our steam we release it with skill
so we cuss as we scurry we snort and stampede
up the fifty two steps to attend to our need
on the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed
a botanical gem symbiotic we learn
a bizarre kind of growth some avoid with concern
it's an insight from moss
so i queried some poets who dance 'cross our pages
with such lightness and patterns and passion filled phrases
when your guidance is sought by one earnest and wide eyed
do you deign to reply just to prop up your self pride
do you tell her 'it's simple just read all you can
about me and my writing how fluid i am'
or perhaps you're a mentor by nature and offer
to pry open the portals and share like an author
who reveals all his notes although mental they be
yes 'mong even the great ones we've heard of a few
so our resolute neophyte meets with the names
those whose art she reads daily and counsel she claims
some are eager to share of their passion for rhyme
yes but what about consonance diction and sound
non traditional verse deserves no less esteem
in the end all agree that emotion's the key
to give access to mystery tragedy joy
let your passion be sovereign your unrivaled guide
you are artist at canvass palette at your side
twas the night before christmas when all thro' the house
not a creature was stirring not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads
nd mamma in her 'kerchief and i in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
away to the window i flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
gave the lustre of mid day to objects below
when what to my wondering eyes should appear
but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer
with a little old driver so lively and quick
i knew in a moment it must be st nick
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name
now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen
on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen
to the top of the porch to the top of the wall
now dash away dash away dash away all
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky
so up to the house top the coursers they flew
with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too
and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof
as i drew in my head and was turning around
down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack
his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry
his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
he had a broad face and a little round belly
that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly
he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf
and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself
a wink of his eye and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread
he spoke not a word but went straight to his work
and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk
and laying his finger aside of his nose
and giving a nod up the chimney he rose
he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle
but i heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight
happy christmas to all and to all a good night
when the sparklers have sparked and the cannons have boomed
and the flags have been flown and the flowers have bloomed
when the coleslaw arrives and the meat has been grilled
and the children have played and the bellies are filled
when the families have left after long fond good byes
and the tables are cleared we sit back with a sigh
then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile
and with fondness remember the day for awhile
but perhaps in the midst of the party and fun
we've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won
let us never forget the great war that was fought
and the price for our freedom in blood dearly bought
for the wisest of men said that truth sets you free
and to let freedom ring truth was nailed to a tree
now that i tying thy glass mask tightly
may gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely
as thou pliest thy trade in this devil's smithy
which is the poison to poison her prithee
he is with her and they know that i know
where they are what they do they believe my tears flow
while they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear
empty church to pray god in for them i am here
grind away moisten and mash up thy paste
pound at thy powder i am not in haste
better sit thus and observe thy strange things
than go where men wait me and dance at the king's
that in the mortar you call it a gum
ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come
and yonder soft phial the exquisite blue
sure to taste sweetly is that poison too
had i but all of them thee and thy treasures
what a wild crowd of invisible pleasures
to carry pure death in an earring a casket
a signet a fan mount a filigree basket
soon at the king's a mere lozenge to give
and pauline should have just thirty minutes to live
but to light a pastile and elise with her head
and her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead
quick is it finished the colour's too grim
why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim
let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir
and try it and taste ere she fix and prefer
what a drop she's not little no minion like me
that's why she ensnared him this never will free
the soul from those masculine eyes say no
to that pulse's magnificent come and go
for only last night as they whispered i brought
my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought
could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall
shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all
not that i bid you spare her the pain
let death be felt and the proof remain
brand burn up bite into its grace
he is sure to remember her dying face
is it done take my mask off nay be not morose
it kills her and this prevents seeing it close
the delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee
if it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me
now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill
you may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will
but brush this dust off me lest horror it brings
ere i know it next moment i dance at the king's
listen my children and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the eighteenth of april in seventy five
hardly a man is now alive
who remembers that famous day and year
he said to his friend 'if the british march
by land or sea from the town to night
hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the north church tower as a signal light
one if by land and two if by sea
and i on the opposite shore will be
ready to ride and spread the alarm
through every middlesex village and farm
for the country folk to be up and to arm'
then he said 'good night' and with muffled oar
silently rowed to the charlestown shore
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset british man of war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
across the moon like a prison bar
and a huge black hulk that was magnified
by its own reflection in the tide
meanwhile his friend through alley and street
wanders and watches with eager ears
till in the silence around him he hears
the muster of men at the barrack door
the sound of arms and the tramp of feet
and the measured tread of the grenadiers
marching down to their boats on the shore
then he climbed the tower of the old north church
by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread
to the belfry chamber overhead
and startled the pigeons from their perch
on the sombre rafters that round him made
masses and moving shapes of shade
by the trembling ladder steep and tall
to the highest window in the wall
where he paused to listen and look down
a moment on the roofs of the town
and the moonlight flowing over all
beneath in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel's tread
the watchful night wind as it went
creeping along from tent to tent
and seeming to whisper 'all is well'
a moment only he feels the spell
of the place and the hour and the secret dread
of the lonely belfry and the dead
for suddenly all his thoughts are bent
on a shadowy something far away
where the river widens to meet the bay
a line of black that bends and floats
on the rising tide like a bridge of boats
meanwhile impatient to mount and ride
booted and spurred with a heavy stride
on the opposite shore walked paul revere
now he patted his horse's side
now gazed at the landscape far and near
then impetuous stamped the earth
and turned and tightened his saddle girth
but mostly he watched with eager search
the belfry tower of the old north church
as it rose above the graves on the hill
lonely and spectral and sombre and still
and lo as he looks on the belfry's height
a glimmer and then a gleam of light
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
but lingers and gazes till full on his sight
a second lamp in the belfry burns
a hurry of hoofs in a village street
a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark
and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet
that was all and yet through the gloom and the light
the fate of a nation was riding that night
and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight
kindled the land into flame with its heat
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
is the mystic meeting the ocean tides
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides
it was twelve by the village clock
when he crossed the bridge into medford town
he heard the crowing of the cock
and the barking of the farmer's dog
and felt the damp of the river fog
that rises after the sun goes down
it was one by the village clock
when he galloped into lexington
he saw the gilded weathercock
swim in the moonlight as he passed
and the meeting house windows blank and bare
gaze at him with a spectral glare
as if they already stood aghast
at the bloody work they would look upon
it was two by the village clock
when he came to the bridge in concord town
he heard the bleating of the flock
and the twitter of birds among the trees
and felt the breath of the morning breeze
blowing over the meadows brown
and one was safe and asleep in his bed
who at the bridge would be first to fall
who that day would be lying dead
pierced by a british musket ball
you know the rest in the books you have read
how the british regulars fired and fled
how the farmers gave them ball for ball
from behind each fence and farm yard wall
chasing the red coats down the lane
then crossing the fields to emerge again
under the trees at the turn of the road
and only pausing to fire and load
so through the night rode paul revere
and so through the night went his cry of alarm
to every middlesex village and farm
a cry of defiance and not of fear
a voice in the darkness a knock at the door
and a word that shall echo forevermore
for borne on the night wind of the past
through all our history to the last
in the hour of darkness and peril and need
the people will waken and listen to hear
the hurrying hoof beats of that steed
and the midnight message of paul revere
does it matter losing your legs
for people will always be kind
and you need not show that you mind
to gobble their muffins and eggs
does it matter losing your sight
there's such splendid work for the blind
and people will always be kind
as you sit on the terrace remembering
and turning your face to the light
do they matter those dreams from the pit
you can drink and forget and be glad
and people won't say that you're mad
for they'll know you've fought for your country
and no one will worry a bit
o rose thou art sick
the invisible worm
that flies in the night
in the howling storm
has found out thy bed
of crimson joy
and his dark secret love
does thy life destroy
the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold
and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold
and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea
when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee
like the leaves of the forest when summer is green
that host with their banners at sunset were seen
like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown
that host on the morrow lay withered and strown
for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast
and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed
and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill
and their hearts but once heaved and for ever grew still
and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide
but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride
and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf
and cold as the spray of the rock beating surf
and there lay the rider distorted and pale
with the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail
and the tents were all silent the banners alone
the lances unlifted the trumpet unblown
autumn is wearing her bright golden crown
for this morning shes coming to visit our town
and wind her best friend will be joining her too
will they have a nice day and just what will they do
shell be changing the colours of leaves on our trees
and wind likes to tease with his cold playful breeze
as the leaves tumble down in a pile on the ground
he will take a deep breath and blow them around
they'll both knock down conkers for children to find
but the nuts arent just there for the good of mankind
the squirrels like nuts and theyll store them away
but then out they will come on those cold wintry days
so what do you think that the two friends might eat
what sorts of things would be good for a treat
there are sweet tasting berries and fruits of all kinds
which are wonderful treats for the two friends to find
they will chase over hills and along by the river
winds cold wintry breath may well cause us to shiver
the swallows will see them and say their goodbye
calling see you next year as they fly through the sky
with the sun going down theres no time left to play
but the two friends have had such a marvellous day
when you look all around at this colourful scene
you will see very clearly where these friends have been
the tiger stretches limb by limb
he views his world through sleepy eyes
and wonders what his day will bring
he does these things and so do i
the bear sets forth to hunt for food
and rambles under cloudy skies
he ponders what hell eat today
he looks for food and so do i
all creatures teach their young to hunt
and watch for danger lest they die
the parents teach the skills of life
their young learn these and so do i
the creatures of the day will seek
a place to sleep thats warm and dry
a safe abode thats far from harm
they drift to sleep and so do i
the bull in the meadow was bellowing hard
with a bawling and blustering blare
but the cows thought the bull was just showing off
and continued to graze without care
his shouting his screaming his clamorous cry
continued by day and by night
his vociferous roaring soon got on their nerves
whilst the mice and the birds fled in fright
the farmer then noticed the terrible noise
and he called in the vet to the scene
the vet scratched his head and only could say
its the noisiest bull that ive seen
i remember he lived at the farm up the road
and he had a particular friend
i suggest that you buy her to go with your herd
and im sure that his roaring will end
so next week a new cow arrived in their field
shed been bought from the neighbouring farm
shed endearing brown eyes and a beautiful face
was friendly and so full of charm
oh maisie my girlfriend the noisy bull said
how ive missed you since we said goodbye
it was obvious that maisie was pleased to see him
and mooed with delight in reply
now peace reigns supremely the pastures are quiet
theres birdsong and flowers in the spring
and everyones happy especially the bull
yes loves truly a wonderful thing
there was a field in nazareth beside a joiner's yard
a little donkey stood and sighed his life had been so hard
im getting old and not much use for carrying heavy loads
for trudging round the town all day on hot and dusty roads
his kindly master joseph said you mustnt worry now
just spend your old age quietly wth bess our milking cow
so bess and he stayed in the field and watched the world go by
when suddenly from heaven appeared an angel in the sky
theres one last job on earth for you a journey to be done
a special donkeys what we need for mary and her son
from nazareth to bethlehem that is the road to take
weve chosen you to do this task especially for gods sake
but i am old and useless the little donkey cried
but there again id like the job for i feel quite young inside
the day arrived and off they set in sunshine warm and bright
they travelled over dusty roads arriving before night
there were such a lot of people bethlehem was really packed
and many other donkeys came with loads upon their backs
the only place they all could rest was in a stable warm
the little donkey stood nearby when jesus christ was born
he went to sleep so happy im not useless after all
he dreamed about an angel who came to his stable stall
your work on earth is finished come to heaven and take your rest
god will love to have you with him of all donkeys youre the best
im the king of the deep and rule all i survey

i'm a breathtaking giant in my global domain
my heart is colossal im streamlined and sleek

blue whale calves will gain weight at ten pounds a day
and for more than a year with their parents they'll stay
i rule the oceans for im king of the deep
i take naps on my journey but don't need to sleep
whilst your kings wear their crowns and magnificent robes
in my mantle of blubber i circle the globe

they say i have strong jaws its true i'll admit
i'm rough and i'm tough and i prowl the wide plain
im both scavenger and nomad with long unkempt mane
i'm tawny i'm brawny and in the rays of this moon
with good fortune my ally i may feed very soon
this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks
bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight
stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic
stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms
darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven
speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest
this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it
leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman
where is the thatch roofed village the home of acadian farmers
men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands
waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october
seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean
naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand pr
ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient
ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion
list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest
list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy
in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas
distant secluded still the little village of grand pr
lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward
giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant
shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood gates
opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows
west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields
spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain and away to the northward
blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains
sea fogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic
looked on the happy valley but ne'er from their station descended
there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village
strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock
such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries
thatched were the roofs with dormer windows and gables projecting
over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway
there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset
lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys
matrons and maidens sat in snow white caps and in kirtles
scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden
flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors
mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens
solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children
paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them
reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens
hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome
then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank
down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry
softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village
columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending
rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment
thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers
dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from
fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas
benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grand pr
dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household
gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village
stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters
hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes
white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak leaves
fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers
black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside
black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses
sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows
when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
flagons of home brewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden
fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret
sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop
sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them
down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal
wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the ear rings
brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom
handed down from mother to child through long generations
but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty
shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession
homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her
when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music
firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer
stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady
sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it
rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath
led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow
under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a penthouse
such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside
built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its moss grown
bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses
shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard
there stood the broad wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows
there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio
strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame
voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter
bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one
far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase
under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft
there too the dove cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates
murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes
numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation
thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grand pr
lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household
many a youth as he knelt in church and opened his missal
fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion
happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended
and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps
knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron
or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village
bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music
but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome
gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith
who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men
for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations
has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people
basil was benedict's friend their children from earliest childhood
grew up together as brother and sister and father felician
priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters
out of the self same book with the hymns of the church and the plain song
but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed
swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith
there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him
take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything
nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cart wheel
lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders
oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness
bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice
warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows
and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes
merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel
oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle
down the hillside bounding they glided away o'er the meadow
oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters
seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow
brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings
lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow
thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children
he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning
gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action
she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman
sunshine of saint eulalie' was she called for that was the sunshine
which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples
she too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance
filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children
now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer
and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters
birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the ice bound
desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands
harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september
wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel
all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season
called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all saints
filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape
lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean
was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended
voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farm yards
whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons
all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun
looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him
while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow
bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest
flashed like the plane tree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels
now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness
day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending
brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead
pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other
and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening
foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer
proud of her snow white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar
quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside
where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watch dog
patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct
walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly
waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers
regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector
when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled
late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes
laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor
cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks
while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles
painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson
nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms
patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders
unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence
into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended
lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm yard
echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness
heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barn doors
rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent
in doors warm by the wide mouthed fireplace idly the farmer
sat in his elbow chair and watched how the flames and the smoke wreaths
struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him
nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic
darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm chair
laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser
caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas
such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him
sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards
close at her father's side was the gentle evangeline seated
spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
followed the old man's song and united the fragments together
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases
footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar
so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked
thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted
sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges
benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith
and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him
welcome' the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold
welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle
close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee
take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco
never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes'
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith
taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside
benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with
gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them
happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe'
pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him
and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued
four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors
ride in the gaspereau's mouth with their cannon pointed against us
what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded
on the morrow to meet in the church where his majesty's mandate
will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time
many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people'
then made answer the farmer 'perhaps some friendlier purpose
brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england
by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted
and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children'
not so thinketh the folk in the village' said warmly the blacksmith
shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued
louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sjour nor port royal
many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts
waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow
arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds
nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower'
then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer
safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields
safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean
than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemy's cannon
fear no evil my friend and to night may no shadow of sorrow
fall on this house and earth for this is the night of the contract
built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village
strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them
filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth
ren leblanc will be here anon with his papers and ink horn
shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children'
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's
blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken
and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered
bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean
bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public
shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung
over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows
sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal
father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred
children's children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick
four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive
suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english
now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion
ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike
he was beloved by all and most of all by the children
for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest
and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses
and of the white ltiche the ghost of a child who unchristened
died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children
and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable
and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell
and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes
with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village
then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith
knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand
father leblanc' he exclaimed 'thou hast heard the talk in the village
and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand'
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public
gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser
and what their errand may be i know not better than others
yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention
brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us'
god's name' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith
must we in all things look for the how and the why and the where fore
daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest'
but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public
man is unjust but god is just and finally justice
triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me
when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal'
this was the old man's favorite tale and he loved to repeat it
when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them
once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember
raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice
stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand
and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided
over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people
even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance
having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them
but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted
might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty
ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a nobleman's palace
that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion
fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household
she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold
patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice
as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended
lo o'er the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder
smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand
down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance
and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie
into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven'
silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith
stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language
all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors
freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter
then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table
filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed
nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr
while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink horn
wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties
naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle
orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed
and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin
then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver
and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom
lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed
while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside
till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner
soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men
laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manuvre
laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row
meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure
sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise
over the pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows
silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven
blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels
thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry
rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway
rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household
many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step
lingered long in evangeline's heart and filled it with gladness
carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone
and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer
soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed
up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness
lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden
silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press
ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage
better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight
streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden
swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with
naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard
waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow
yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness
passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass
forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps
as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar
pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr
pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas
where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor
life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor
knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning
now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets
came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants
many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows
where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward
group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway
long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced
thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors
sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted
for with this simple people who lived like brothers together
all things were held in common and what one had was another's
yet under benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant
for evangeline stood among the guests of her father
bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness
fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it
under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard
stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal
there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated
there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith
not far withdrawn from these by the cider press and the beehives
michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white
hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler
glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle
tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunquerque
and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
under the orchard trees and down the path to the meadows
old folk and young together and children mingled among them
fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedict's daughter
noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith
so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous
sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat
thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard
waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones
garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest
then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them
entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor
echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement
echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal
closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers
then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar
holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission
you are convened this day' he said 'by his majesty's orders
clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness
let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper
painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous
yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch
namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds
forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province
be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there
ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people
prisoners now i declare you for such is his majesty's pleasure'
as when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer
suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones
beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows
hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs
bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures
so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose
louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger
and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway
vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations
rang through the house of prayer and high o'er the heads of the others
rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith
as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted
down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance
death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests'
more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier
smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement
in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention
lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician
entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar
raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence
all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people
deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful
spake he as after the tocsin's alarum distinctly the clock strikes
what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you
forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you
not in word alone but in deed to love one another
is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations
have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness
this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it
thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred
lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you
see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion
hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them
let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us
let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them'
few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people
sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak
while they repeated his prayer and said 'o father forgive them'
then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar
fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded
not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria
sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated
rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven
meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides
wandered wailing from house to house the women and children
long at her father's door evangeline stood with her right hand
shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending
lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each
peasant's cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows
long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table
there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers
there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy
and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer
thus did evangeline wait at her father's door as the sunset
threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows
ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen
and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended
charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience
then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village
cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women
as o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed
urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children
down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors
veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai
sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded
meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered
all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows
stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion
gabriel' cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer
came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living
slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father
smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted
empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror
sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber
in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall
loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window
keenly the lightning flashed and governed the voice of the echoing thunder
told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created
then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven
soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning
four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day
cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse
soon o'er the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession
came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women
driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore
pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings
ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland
close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen
while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings
thus to the gaspereau's mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach
piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants
all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply
all day long the wains came laboring down from the village
late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting
echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard
thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors
opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession
followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers
even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country
sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn
so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended
down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters
foremost the young men came and raising together their voices
sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions
sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain
fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience'
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside
joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them
mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed
half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence
not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction
calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her
and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion
tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him
clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered
gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another
nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen'
smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father
saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect
gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep
heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom
but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him
speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not
thus to the gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession
there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion
wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children
left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried
while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father
half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight
deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean
fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach
covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed
farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons
like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle
all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them
lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean
dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving
inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures
sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders
lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard
waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk maid
silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded
rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows
but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled
built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest
round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered
voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish
wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering
like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea shore
thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father
and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man
haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion
e'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him
vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not
but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight
benedicite' murmured the priest in tones of compassion
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents
faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold
hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence
suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red
moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and o'er the horizon
titan like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow
seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together
broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village
gleamed on the sky and sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead
columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were
thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting
whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops
started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled
these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard
speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish
we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr'
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards
thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle
came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments
far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska
when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind
or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river
such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses
broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed o'er the meadows
overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden
gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them
and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion
lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore
motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed
slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden
knelt at her father's side and wailed aloud in her terror
then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom
through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber
and when she awoke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her
faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her
pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape
reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her
and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people
let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season
brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile
then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church yard'
such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side
having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches
but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr
and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow
lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation
solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges
twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean
with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking
and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor
leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins
many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr
when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed
bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
exile without an end and without an example in story
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed
scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast
strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city
from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas
from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters
seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean
deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth
friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken
asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside
written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards
long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered
lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things
fair was she and young but alas before her extended
dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway
marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her
passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned
as the emigrant's way o'er the western desert is marked by
camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine
something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished
as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine
suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended
into the east again from whence it late had arisen
sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her
urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit
she would commence again her endless search and endeavor
sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones
sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom
he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him
sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper
came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward
sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him
but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten
gabriel lajeunesse' they said 'oh yes we have seen him
he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies
coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers'
gabriel lajeunesse' said others 'oh yes we have seen him
he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana'
then would they say 'dear child why dream and wait for him longer
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others
who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
here is baptiste leblanc the notary's son who has loved thee
many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy
thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherine's tresses'
then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly 'i cannot
whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere
for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway
many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness'
thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor
said with a smile 'o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee
talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted
if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning
back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment
that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain
patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection
sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike
therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike
purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven'
cheered by the good man's words evangeline labored and waited
still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean
but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered 'despair not'
thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence
let me essay o muse to follow the wanderer's footsteps
not through each devious path each changeful year of existence
but as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley
far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water
here and there in some open space and at intervals only
then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it
though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur
happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet
it was the month of may far down the beautiful river
past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash
into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi
floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen
it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked
nation scattered along the coast now floating together
bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune
men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay
sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers
on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas
with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician
onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests
day after day they glided adown the turbulent river
night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike
cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current
then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars
lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin
shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river
shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens
stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer
where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron
sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine
soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters
which like a network of steel extended in every direction
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air
waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons
home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset
or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water
gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches
down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them
and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness
strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed
as at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies
far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa
so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil
shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it
but evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision that faintly
floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight
it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom
through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her
and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer
then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen
and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure
sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang
breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest
soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music
multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance
over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches
but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness
and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence
then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight
silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs
such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers
while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert
far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest
mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator
thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them
lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya
water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations
made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus
lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen
faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms
and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands
fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses
near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber
soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended
under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin
safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward
tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered
over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar
swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine
hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob
on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending
were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom
such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it
filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven
lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial
nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands
darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver
at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn
dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness
somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written
gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless
sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow
swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island
but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos
so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows
all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers
angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden
swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance
as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden
said with a sigh to the friendly priest 'o father felician
something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders
is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition
or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit'
then with a blush she added 'alas for my credulous fancy
unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning'
but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered
daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning
feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface
is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden
therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions
gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward
on the banks of the tche are the towns of st maur and st martin
there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom
there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees
under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens
bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana'
with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey
softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon
like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape
twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest
seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together
hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver
floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water
filled was evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness
touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling
glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her
then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers
swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water
shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music
that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen
plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness
seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes
single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation
till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision
as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops
shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches
with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion
slowly they entered the tche where it flows through the green opelousas
and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland
saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling
sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle
near to the bank of the river o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches
garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted
such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide
stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden
girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms
filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers
hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported
rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda
haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden
stationed the dove cots were as love's perpetual symbol
scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals
silence reigned o'er the place the line of shadow and sunshine
ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow
and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding
into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway
through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie
into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas
hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics
stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape vines
just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie
mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups
sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin
broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero
gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master
round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing
quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness
that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape
slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding
fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded
wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening
suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean
silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie
and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance
then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden
saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him
suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward
rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder
when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith
hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden
there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces
laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful
thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings
stole o'er the maiden's heart and basil somewhat embarrassed
broke the silence and said 'if you came by the atchafalaya
how have you nowhere encountered my gabriel's boat on the bayous'
over evangeline's face at the words of basil a shade passed
tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent
gone is gabriel gone' and concealing her face on his shoulder
all her o'erburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented
then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it
be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed
foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses
moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit
could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence
thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever
ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles
he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens
tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him
unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards
thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains
hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver
therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover
he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him
up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning
we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison'
then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river
borne aloft on his comrades' arms came michael the fiddler
long under basil's roof had he lived like a god on olympus
having no other care than dispensing music to mortals
far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle
long live michael' they cried 'our brave acadian minstrel'
as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway
father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man
kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured
hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips
laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters
much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci devant blacksmith
all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor
much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate
and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them
each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver
fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors
brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman
poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion
lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco
thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened
welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless
welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one
here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers
here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer
smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water
all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows
more in a single night than a whole canadian summer
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies
here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber
with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests
no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads
burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle'
speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils
while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table
so that the guests all started and father felician astounded
suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils
but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer
only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever
for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate
cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell'
then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching
sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda
it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters
who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman
merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors
friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers
meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other
drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together
but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding
from the accordant strings of michael's melodious fiddle
broke up all further speech away like children delighted
all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening
whirl of the giddy dance as it swept and swayed to the music
dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments
meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman
sat conversing together of past and present and future
while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her
olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music
heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness
came o'er her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden
beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest
tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river
fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight
like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden
poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions
unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews
hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight
seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings
as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oak trees
passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie
silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fire flies
gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers
over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens
shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship
save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple
as if a hand had appeared and written upon them 'upharsin'
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire flies
wandered alone and she cried 'o gabriel o my beloved
art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee
art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me
ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie
ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me
ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor
thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee'
loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded
like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets
farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
patience' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness
and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded 'to morrow'
bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden
bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses
with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
farewell' said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold
see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine
and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming'
farewell' answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended
down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness
swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them
blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded
found they the trace of his course in lake or forest or river
nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain
rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country
till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes
weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord
that on the day before with horses and guides and companions
gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies
far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains
lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway
opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon
westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee
eastward with devious course among the wind river mountains
through the sweet water valley precipitate leaps the nebraska
and to the south from fontaine qui bout and the spanish sierras
fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert
numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean
like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies
billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine
bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas
over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck
over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses
fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel
over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmael's children
staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails
circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture
like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle
by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens
here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders
here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers
and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert
climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side
and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven
like the protecting hand of god inverted above them
into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains
gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him
day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil
followed his flying steps and thought each day to o'ertake him
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire
rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall
when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary
hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana
showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them
once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered
into their little camp an indian woman whose features
wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people
from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches
where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome
gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them
on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers
but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions
worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison
stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light
flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
then at the door of evangeline's tent she sat and repeated
slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent
all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses
much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another
hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion
yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her
she in turn related her love and all its disasters
mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended
still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror
passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis
mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden
but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam
fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine
till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest
then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation
told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom
that through the pines o'er her father's lodge in the hush of the twilight
breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden
till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest
and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened
to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her
seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose
lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor
touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches
swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers
filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret
subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror
as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits
seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment
that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom
with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished
early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee
said as they journeyed along 'on the western slope of these mountains
dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus
loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him'
then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered
let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us'
thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains
just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices
and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river
saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission
under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village
knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened
high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines
looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it
this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches
of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers
mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches
silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching
knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions
but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen
forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower
slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them
welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression
hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest
and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam
there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear
feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher
soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered
nor six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated
on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes
told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey'
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness
but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes
fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
far to the north he has gone' continued the priest 'but in autumn
when the chase is done will return again to the mission'
then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive
let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted'
so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow
mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions
homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission
slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other
days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing
green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her
lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming
cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens
blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover
but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield
even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover
patience' the priest would say 'have faith and thy prayer will be answered
look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow
see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet
this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted
here in the houseless wild to direct the traveller's journey
over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert
such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion
gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance
but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly
only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter
crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe'
so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not
blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird
sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom
far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests
gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river
and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence
saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches
she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests
found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin
thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places
divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden
now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions
now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army
now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities
like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered
fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey
faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended
each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty
leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead
dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware waters
guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle
stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty
and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest
as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile
finding among the children of penn a home and a country
there old ren leblanc had died and when he departed
saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants
something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city
something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger
and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers
for it recalled the past the old acadian country
where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor
ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining
thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
as from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning
roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us
sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets
so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her
dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway
which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance
gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image
clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him
only more beautiful made by his death like silence and absence
into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not
over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured
he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent
patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others
this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her
so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices
suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma
other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow
meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour
thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting
lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city
where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight
where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated
loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city
high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs
plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market
met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings
then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city
presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons
darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september
flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow
so death flooded life and o'erflowing its natural margin
spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence
wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor
but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger
only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants
crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless
then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands
now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket
meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seemed to echo
softly the words of the lord 'the poor ye always have with you'
thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying
looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there
gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor
such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles
or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance
unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial
into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter
thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent
wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse
sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden
and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them
that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty
then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind
distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church
while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted
sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco
soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit
something within her said 'at length thy trials are ended'
and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness
noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants
moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence
closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces
where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside
many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered
turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence
fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison
and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler
laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever
many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time
vacant their places were or filled already by strangers
suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder
still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder
ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers
and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning
then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish
that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows
on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man
long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples
but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment
seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood
so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever
as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals
that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted
seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness
darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking
then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations
heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded
whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like
gabriel o my beloved' and died away into silence
then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood
green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them
village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow
as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision
tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids
vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside
vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered
died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken
vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him
kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom
sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness
as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement
all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow
all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing
all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom
meekly she bowed her own and murmured 'father i thank thee'
still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow
side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping
under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard
in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed
daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them
thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever
thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy
thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors
thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey
still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches
dwells another race with other customs and language
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic
linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile
wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy
maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun
and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story
while from its rocky caverns the deep voiced neighboring ocean

should you ask me whence these stories
whence these legends and traditions
with the odors of the forest
with the dew and damp of meadows
with the curling smoke of wigwams
with the rushing of great rivers
with their frequent repetitions
and their wild reverberations
as of thunder in the mountains
i should answer i should tell you
from the forests and the prairies
from the great lakes of the northland
from the land of the ojibways
from the land of the dacotahs
from the mountains moors and fenlands
where the heron the shuhshuhgah
feeds among the reeds and rushes
i repeat them as i heard them
from the lips of nawadaha
the musician the sweet singer
should you ask where nawadaha
found these songs so wild and wayward
found these legends and traditions
in the bird'snests of the forest
in the lodges of the beaver
in the hoofprints of the bison
in the eyry of the eagle
all the wildfowl sang them to him
in the moorlands and the fenlands
in the melancholy marshes
chetowaik the plover sang them
mahng the loon the wildgoose wawa
the blue heron the shuhshuhgah
and the grouse the mushkodasa
if still further you should ask me
saying who was nawadaha
tell us of this nawadaha
i should answer your inquiries
straightway in such words as follow
in the vale of tawasentha
in the green and silent valley
by the pleasant watercourses
dwelt the singer nawadaha
round about the indian village
spread the meadows and the cornfields
and beyond them stood the forest
stood the groves of singing pinetrees
green in summer white in winter
ever sighing ever singing
and the pleasant watercourses
you could trace them through the valley
by the rushing in the springtime
by the alders in the summer
by the white fog in the autumn
by the black line in the winter
and beside them dwelt the singer
there he sang of hiawatha
sang the song of hiawatha
sang his wondrous birth and being
how he prayed and how be fasted
how he lived and toiled and suffered
that the tribes of men might prosper
that he might advance his people
ye who love the haunts of nature
love the sunshine of the meadow
love the shadow of the forest
love the wind among the branches
and the rainshower and the snowstorm
and the rushing of great rivers
through their palisades of pinetrees
and the thunder in the mountains
whose innumerable echoes
flap like eagles in their eyries
listen to these wild traditions
to this song of hiawatha
ye who love a nation's legends
love the ballads of a people
that like voices from afar off
call to us to pause and listen
speak in tones so plain and childlike
scarcely can the ear distinguish
whether they are sung or spoken
listen to this indian legend
ye whose hearts are fresh and simple
who have faith in god and nature
who believe that in all ages
every human heart is human
that in even savage bosoms
there are longings yearnings strivings
for the good they comprehend not
that the feeble hands and helpless
groping blindly in the darkness
touch god's right hand in that darkness
and are lifted up and strengthened
listen to this simple story
ye who sometimes in your rambles
through the green lanes of the country
where the tangled barberrybushes
hang their tufts of crimson berries
over stone walls gray with mosses
pause by some neglected graveyard
for a while to muse and ponder
on a halfeffaced inscription
written with little skill of songcraft
homely phrases but each letter
full of hope and yet of heartbreak
full of all the tender pathos
of the here and the hereafter
stay and read this rude inscription
read this song of hiawatha
on the day of the explosion
shadows pointed towards the pithead
in thesun the slagheap slept
down the lane came men in pitboots
coughing oathedged talk and pipesmoke
shouldering off the freshened silence
one chased after rabbits
came back with a nest of lark's eggs
showed them
so they passed in beards and moleskins
fathers brothers nicknames laughter
through the tall gates standing open
at noon there came a tremor
stopped chewing for a second
scarfed as in a heathaze dimmed
the dead go on before us they
are sitting in god's house in comfort
we shall see them face to face
plian as lettering in the chapels
it was said and for a second
wives saw men of the explosion
larger than in life they managed
gold as on a coin or walking
somehow from the sun towards them
one showing the eggs unbroken
through the forest have i gone
but athenian found i none
on whose eyes i might approve
this flower's force in stirring love
night and silencewho is here
weeds of athens he doth wear
this is he my master said
despised the athenian maid
and here the maiden sleeping sound
on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul she durst not lie
near this lacklove this killcourtesy
churl upon thy eyes i throw
all the power this charm doth owe
when thou wakest let love forbid
sleep his seat on thy eyelid
so awake when i am gone
for i must now to oberon
tom will throw his head at them avaunt you curs
be thy mouth or black or white
tooth that poisons if it bite
mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
hound or spaniel brach or him
or bobtail tyke or trundletail
tom will make him weep and wail
for with throwing thus my head
dogs leap the hatch and all are fled
then will two at once woo one
that must needs be sport alone
and those things do best please me
that befal preposterously
stand aside the noise they make
will cause demetrius to awake
captain of our fairy band
helena is here at hand
and the youth mistook by me
pleading for a lover's fee
shall we their fond pageant see
lord what fools these mortals be
flower of this purple dye
hit with cupid's archery
sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy
let her shine as gloriously
as the venus of the sky
when thou wakest if she be by
beg of her for remedy
